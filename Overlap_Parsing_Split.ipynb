Sleek. Shiny. Built for the future. Just like us. Connected   The Richland Two Charter High School was founded in 2010 for students looking for a modern approach to their high school learning experience. Students at the Charter School customize their education using our virtual curriculum and design a flexible attendance schedule to meet their individual needs. In 2013, the Charter School opened its doors to students in the 9th through 12th grade. Our extended hours of operation allow students the flexibility to work during the day and complete their coursework by taking advantage of our nighttime hours. Our major advantage over other online schools is our faculty and staff. By employing a full time school counselor, English teacher, Math teacher, Work Based Learning Coordinator and Lab Specialist, students can ask questions and receive individualized attention.  Your Future Starts Now! Blended Virtual High School Environment 9 th through 12 th Grades Flexible School Day Small School Experience SC High School Diploma Extra-Curricular Activities available at Home School Exposure to Real World Careers 21st Century Learning Opportunities Support from Local Business Partners   The Richland Two Charter High School is open for student use Monday through Thursday, 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM and Friday until 3:00 PM. During Evening Hours, please keep in mind : The lab will close at 7:10 PM if no students have arrived by that time. Please arrive no later than 6:00 PM to take quizzes and tests. Students will not be permitted to log on to a computer after 7:10 PM (this allows at least thirty 30 minutes to complete any work before having to log out by 7:45 PM). The latest start time for a course exam is 6:45 PM (this allows a one-hour minimum per exam session as the length of exams varies from course to course). Monday through Thursday, all computers must be shut down by 7:45 PM. Fridays, all computers must be shut down by 2:45 PM. Students working from home and have questions are encouraged call the computer lab at 803-419-1348. Please note that the lab in use may differ from night to night according to which staffer is attending. See the list below. Evening Computer Lab Hours by Staff (4:00 PM to Close)​ ​ ​ ​ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  Dr. Perry Mills, Sr. - Principal Ann Holland - Work-Based Learning Coordinator​ Brian Stiles - English Teacher | Testing Coordinator​ Angela Bright - School Counselor Dr. Mills available at 12 noon. Ann Holland available at 12 noon. Brian Stiles available at 12 noon. Allen Upchurch - Math Teacher Angela Bright and Allen Upchurch available at 12 noon.  ​   Where do I take my classes? Classes are offered through the internet. We have partnered with Richland School District Two to provide your classes via the Virtual High School already established within the district. Students have access to our full-time English teacher, math tutor, and lab specialist.  Can I finish one subject area before starting another? Your core classes will be tailored to your learning style with help from our highly certified teachers and staff to meet your learning needs. If that is how you learn best, then you can complete one class before taking the next.  How many students are you accepting? We can enroll a maximum of 20 freshman, 20 sophomores, 40 juniors, and 40 seniors. (120 students maximum.) If there are more than 120 applicants then students will be chosen by lottery.  Do I pay tuition to attend the Richland Two Charter High School? There is absolutely no tuition for attending Richland Two Charter High School.  What are the graduation requirements at the Richland Two Charter High School? In addition to the South Carolina graduation requirements, all students must complete the entire sequence of the \"Leadership and Development\" courses, which are designed to provide soft skills training and offer internship opportunities. This course sequence must be completed in order to be eligible to graduate from the Richland Two Charter High School.  Will I get paid for my internship programs? Some programs may have a salary associated with them, however, we do not guarantee that you will be paid for your internships.  Will I graduate with my class at my old high school? You will be awarded a South Carolina High School Diploma upon your graduation and will graduate with the students at the Richland Two Charter High School, not at the high school that you were previously zoned for.

What is Dual Enrollment?  Dual Enrollment is taking college classes while you are still in high school. Sometimes these classes can also count toward high school credits. These courses can save you thousands of dollars in tuition costs; And shorten the time it takes to earn a college degree.  Each year, hundreds of dedicated high school students take these courses through MTC’s Dual Enrollment program, and get a jump-start on their college education! There are a few different options:  Work with your school to get approval to come to MTC and take Dual Enrollment classes on one of our six regional campuses. Find out if you’re in a district where MTC faculty are already teaching courses in your high school. Take Dual Enrollment courses that are available online.  Please see your high school guidance counselor to find out which option is best for you. Who is Eligible?

Students who enroll in courses held on MTC campuses are responsible for the cost of tuition, fees, and books. *** If you take at least six college credit hours during a semester, that may reduce your tuition greatly by receiving South Carolina Lottery Tuition Assistance. *** We’ll help you through the financial aid process, and you can find more information on the Lottery Tuition Assistance form .
