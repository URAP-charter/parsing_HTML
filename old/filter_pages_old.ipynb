       "  'Dear Interested Citizen,\\nThe Mobile Area Education Foundation has served as an advocate and activist for public schools in the Mobile community for the last twenty-two years. Our core beliefs and values remain an integral part of everything we do, especially now as we begin to write our next chapter. We are redefining our priorities, and continuing our broad-based citizen engagement approach that has proven itself time and time again with the success of the Yes We Can movement.\\nMAEF, in partnership with the school district and business and civic leaders across Mobile County, is increasing the chances that students will Graduate Ready for college and careers.\\nWe support our public school system in transforming schools across the county to increase high school graduation rates. We create partnerships with industry leaders to develop students’ workforce skills in Mobile County Career Academies. We help to improve the quality of life in Mobile County by increasing the volunteer base and the number of citizens actively involved in community efforts to improve educational outcomes for children. We create a civic culture of continual improvement across Mobile County.\\nThrough these efforts we have seen the graduation rate increase over 20 percentage points in the past three years. We set the goal to graduate at least 80 percent of our public school students ready for college, career, and life by 2020, and that goal is not too far out of our reach.\\nHowever, the work is just getting started. We will continue to offer programs like the Evening Education Options Program that targets students who are at risk of dropping out because they are over-aged and under credited. By focusing on growing our volunteer base, our Reading Buddy program will ensure students are reading on grade level by the end of third grade. To provide the intervention needed to help middle grade students improve their academic progress as they create a roadmap to graduating on time we use the RAMP UP to Graduation Initiative. Engaging Youth through Engineering will continue to redesign the way math and science are taught in our schools, while introducing STEM to students as early as fourth grade.\\nThe Mobile Area Education Foundation is working to create a better community, one graduate at a time. We know we can’t do this alone. Every volunteer hour, and every dollar contribution, puts us one step closer to improving the quality of life for every resident of Mobile County. I’d like to invite you to become a part of the movement to improve the lives of all Mobile County citizens, children, and future generations of Mobile workers. We’re proud of accomplishments to date and look forward to opportunities ahead.\\nCarolyn Akers\\n MAEF Chief Executive Officer\\nOur Purpose\\nAt MAEF our goals are to innovate for student achievement, enhance strategic partnerships, and to build a community driven platform. We encourage innovative practices and programs that expedite student achievement by providing tools, providing development, and advancing promising innovations. We also partner with area business and industry to graduate students career ready by knowing the recipient, knowing the givers, and evaluating partners for satisfaction, impact, and growth. Lastly, we inspire action to build a high quality public education system by establishing easy metrics, using simple communication channels, and creating a Donor-Centric funding model.\\nOur Vision\\nWe exist because we believe the community’s potential can only be realized when all its citizens have access to high quality public education.\\nOur Mission\\nOur mission is to build community responsibility for improving public school outcomes in Mobile County.

Nearly forty-five students will be wearing a cap and gown next week. The students came from public and private schools in Mobile and Baldwin Counties, as well as home-schools. The students, for a variety of reasons, wanted something other than traditional school.\\nNews 5 stopped by and talked to two graduating seniors, Delwin Turner and Chantal Reyes.

Every high school now offers Advanced Placement courses. Focused attention is being brought to ensure that more students are reading on grade level at the end of third grade—a leading early indicator of starting on track to graduation. Likewise, more students are taking the math courses they need to handle algebra in middle school, an indicator that students remain on track.\\nTo ensure every student in Mobile County graduates ready, we are raising the bar. For the first time, starting in the 2014-15 school year, every high school student will take the ACT college entrance exam—not just those who can afford it or those with stated plans to go to college. And, we are working to increase the average ACT score to 21, a nationally recognized indicator that a student is prepared for—and can persist through—college-level courses.\\nBeyond K-12, new attention across Mobile County is being paid to ensuring universal access to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten for our youngest learners, ensuring that they start school ready to learn.\\nThe school district is also working to ensure postsecondary access to students moving forward—whether in structured training opportunities, two-year degrees in community college or associate programs, or four-year university degrees.\\nAs a result, high school graduation rates in Mobile County are on the rise. They are up nearly 20 percentage points in the past three years. The reason is a combination of focus and accountability. For students who are over-age and under-credited, we have established new credit recovery options. We have brought a laser-like focus to the issue, making sure that schools offer more rigor to everybody, not just some.\\nEmployer Impact\\nThe best economic stimulus package in the Mobile region is increasing qualified high school graduates.\\nAccording to the Alliance for Excellent Education: If 90 percent of the MCPSS class of 2012 had earned a high school diploma, an increase of 1,900 graduates, the benefits to Mobile County would include:\\n100 new jobs\\n$16 million increase in annual earnings\\n$12 million increase in annual spending\\n$19 million increase in annual gross regional product\\n$28 million increase in home sales\\n$2 million increase in auto sales\\n$1.1 million increase in annual state/local tax revenue\\nEvery high school in Mobile County is becoming a Career Academy—focused on the five key industry areas in the Mobile region: aerospace, advanced manufacturing, shipbuilding, health, and teaching and learning.\\nThrough partnerships with industry leaders—including internships, job shadowing and mentors—students are being prepared in rigorous academics, such as science, technology, math and engineering. They are also learning the 21st century skills (communications, collaboration, creativity and problem-solving) they will need to succeed in these industries.\\nCommunity Impact\\nIn 2001, Mobile County voters passed a historic tax referendum that put more money into our public schools than had been allocated in more than 40 years. In 2011, citizens refused to step back—they voted to sustain that increased funding.\\nAll the while, people came together from every sector of the community—folks from churches, businesses, nonprofit organizations; parents, educators, everyday citizens and taxpayers. Around kitchen tables, in coffee shops, churches and libraries, they talked about what they want for Mobile County and our schools. If they didn’t come out, we went to them.\\nThis broad-based citizen engagement is unique to the Mobile story. The collective citizen voice enabled us to raise expectations. And it has brought us all together on a path for continued success.\\nCitizens agree that our quality of life depends on the region being business friendly, family friendly and safe. Citizens also know that improving our schools, and the quality of our graduates, can do a lot to improve other factors that contribute to the overall quality of life in Mobile County.\\nBy improving the quality and employability of our graduates, we increase their chances of higher annual earnings. That gives Mobile County the opportunity to broaden our tax base, which can lead to better parks, bike trails, recreation options, and improvements in the arts—all giving families more to enjoy near home. Those factors can, in turn, help to keep our middle class thriving in the region. And a better quality of life in Mobile can help to keep our young people from looking elsewhere when thinking of where to build their lives and families.\\nAll of that can help to increase our volunteer base and the number of people actively caring for and continuing to support our community.\\nImproving Education Outcomes\\nGet Involved\\nTogether, MAEF, working with the Mobile County Public Schools and leaders throughout the community, will create a civic culture of continual improvement by:\\nEstablishing the entry-level skills needed for Mobile’s workforce and partner with schools to increase the number of students who graduate prepared for high wage, high demand CS\\nEnsuring 80 by 20 results by designing, managing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of district and community work systems\\nCollaboratively building human capital competencies aligned with performance-based assessments\\nSecuring funding and align resources to support innovation in career and college programming\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       "  't Graduate Ready\\nGraduate Ready is a collaborative initiative of education, civic and business leaders aimed at ensuring that all students in Mobile County are:\\nPrepared for success in college and the workplace\\nAble to apply learning in the real world\\nEquipped with 21st century workforce skills\\nThe purpose of the Graduate Ready is to provide multiple personalized pathways and whole child supports for every child that ensure a better quality of life for every citizen of Mobile County.\\nThe four key strategies of the Graduate Ready initiative include:\\nEnsure high-quality teaching and learning from Pre-K through 12th grade\\nTransform all secondary schools to ensure that all students graduate from high school ready for college and career.\\nEnsure postsecondary access and completion\\nSustain improvements through continued education, business and civic leadership\\nA key component of Graduate Ready is the creation of signature Career Academies at each of Mobile County’s 12 high schools. These academies align closely with the business community and with colleges and universities to prepare students for careers that are growing and thriving in Mobile. Business partner involvement is crucial to this endeavor, to provide opportunities such as internships, teacher externships, shadowing, classroom presentations, and mentoring to students enrolled in these academies.\\nBy 2015, all Mobile County public high schools will have a signature academy and a corresponding business advisory group that will provide hands-on working environments geared toward supporting college and career readiness.\\nGraduate Ready is more than just an initiative of MAEF. It is strategic focus for every program and activity of the organization. It is a North Star that focuses our direction in every engagement, with every partner.\\nFor more information on Graduate Ready, please contact \\nChandra Scott\\n.\\nGraduate Ready: Four Strategic Points\\nGraduate Ready sets four strategic priorities for the Mobile community:\\nPriority #1: Support high-quality teaching and learning\\nEducation research is very clear that the single greatest factor for improving student achievement is the quality of the teacher. Students can never graduate ready for college and careers without having consistent, high-performing teachers throughout their school years. Mobile County has many excellent teachers. But we need an effective teacher in every classroom. To help all teachers, we also need high-quality instructional leadership in every school. And our students need high-quality academic and enrichment out-of-school supports to extend their learning and growth before school, after school and in the critical summer months.\\nPriority #2: Create middle and high schools that prepare students for the 21st Century\\nMobile County has made significant progress with its elementary school performance, providing students a solid foundation for middle and high school. However, in middle and high school, student engagement and motivation drops off sharply. While our graduation rate is increasing, it’s still not high enough. Furthermore, many students who receive a high school diploma in Mobile do not have the skills they need to be successful in college and careers. To ensure that every student in Mobile County is ready for the challenges they face after high school, we must put the same energy and resources into transforming our secondary schools that we put into our elementary schools.\\nPriority #3: Invest in student success after high school\\nA strong K-12 system is the foundation for college- and career-ready young Mobilians. But simply graduating with a high school diploma is not enough. Many students still need support and guidance to get into college and to persist in addressing the challenges they face in achieving their college and career goals. In Mobile County, we lack a coordinated network of supports for students after high school. Such a network can help students access postsecondary opportunities, apply for and receive the financial aid they require, and get the mentoring and advice they need to persist in their goals and, ultimately, to attain gainful employment and promotable opportunities.\\nCollege and Career Resources\\nPriority #4: Support Graduate Ready by investing in MAEF\\nMAEF is the premier community-based, non-profit organization focused on improving preK-20 public education in Mobile County. For nearly 30 years, MAEF has helped to change local policy, transform local schools and engage countless citizens in efforts that have increased student achievement and narrowed the achievement gap for deserving students. MAEF has a proven track record of stewardship and performance and serves as the fiscal agent for all county-side activities related to ensuring that Graduate Ready goals are met.\\nContribute Now\\nSearch\\nQuick Links\\nPriority 1: Support\\nPriority 2: Prepare\\nPriority 3: Success\\nPriority 4: Invest\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

The process was created by Carolyn Akers and used first in Mobile after the historic tax referendum passed in 2001.\\nThe goal of the first round of Yes We Can community conversations was convened to launch the creation of a genuinely community-driven, student-centered strategic plan for the Mobile County Public School System. Up until Yes We Can, the school district had created strategic plans, but without the insight and from a broad representation of cross-sector community participation. This strategic planning process was different; it was “co-owned” by the community and the school system.\\nBolstered by what was then the new federal “No Child Left Behind” law, and motivated in large part by the Yes We Can Community Agreement that resulted from this community engagement, the Mobile County School Board joined forces with MAEF and the growing community school reform coalition. Together, they developed an unprecedented performance-based strategic plan for the school system, underscoring a shared commitment to making student achievement and organizational accountability their top priorities.\\nIn 2003, at the end of that historic strategic planning process, another round of community engagement was convened across Mobile County to update and revisit the community-driven strategic plan. This new plan, called the PASSport to Excellence, was based on the Baldrige Quality standards, then considered the most rigorous and effective model for reshaping educational organizations to create high-performance results.\\nThen again in 2006, another round of Yes We Can engagement focused on 35 community meetings, starting September 28, 2006, that took place for seven consecutive Thursday nights across Mobile County. Each meeting, attended by stakeholders across a number of sectors in the community—including educators, parents, business and community leaders, students and higher education officials—served two purposes. The first objective of these community meetings was to take what Akers called a “victory lap,” acknowledging the changes made in the community and school system as a result of the 2001 tax increase. The second purpose was to tap citizen concerns and aspirations for what the school system needed to do next to meet their expectations for high-quality schools in Mobile County.\\nIn addition to providing meaningful citizen engagement into education in Mobile County, the Yes We Can brand has become synonymous with citizen engagement that led to higher accountability for results that led to actual improvements in school and student performance. Because the process led to tangible and demonstrable results, cities across Alabama, including Birmingham and Dothan, as well as cities in states across the country, such as Baton Rouge, LA; Jacksonville, FL; and Oshkosh, WI, have used Yes We Can as model for engaging their own citizens in the process of improving their local public schools.\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

The Education Commission seeks to improve the system of education to ensure improved academic achievement for all young people in Mobile County. The spirit of the Education Commission is that of an entire community working together—school superintendents, university and college presidents, business and community leaders, principals, teachers, and parents—to identify and support ways to ensure high academic achievement.\\nThe mission of the Education Commission is to ensure that every child is prepared for entrance into college or a career upon high school graduation. To carry out this mission, the Education Commission is charged with serving as the accountability mechanism that monitors and reports the progress of education outcomes and its impact on workforce development.\\nIn 2011, the Education Commission developed a series of College/Career Indicators (Dashboard below) that provide trending data to communicate whether:\\nPreschoolers are getting a healthy start\\nElementary students are equipped to become life-long learners\\nMiddle school students are prepared for a smooth transition to high school where they will be empowered to make college and career choices and\\nHigh school students have access to post-secondary options\\nTo address the influx of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)-based jobs in Mobile, the Education Commission is working to expand its focus beyond the education pipeline to the workforce pipeline.

       "  'ough Engineering\\nEngaging Youth Through Engineering (EYE) is a workforce and economic development initiative created to bring relevance to the K-12 mathematics and science curriculum. The goal of EYE is to inspire, engage and prepare middle school students to take the coursework needed to support the growing demand for highly skilled and technology-savvy workers for major industries located in the Mobile area, including aerospace and shipbuilding.\\nStudents use the Engineering Design Process to apply mathematics and science to solve relevant problems in the classroom and produce the technology and products needed in the world today.\\nEYE includes the following programs:\\nEYE Camps and Clubs. EYE camps and clubs offer engineering curriculum to fourth- and fifth-graders at 25 Mobile County schools. Students attend EYE clubs during the school year and then have the opportunity to continue the EYE program at teacher-led summer camps. EYE camps and clubs use the Boston Museum of Science “Engineering is Elementary” units and are led by trained teacher leaders.\\nMiddle Grades Modules. Funded through a grant from the National Science Foundation, EYE Middle Grades Modules are weeklong engineering units that incorporate science and mathematics. Each module is specifically designed to bring relevance and rigor to existing curriculum, with a special emphasis on mathematics. Each module also provides an engineering design challenge, fosters the development of “engineering habits of mind,” integrates technology and other resources to meet the learning needs of a diverse group of students, and deepens understanding of middle grades mathematics and science content.\\nTeacher Workshops. One goal of EYE is to use the engaging work of engineers as innovative problem solvers to “hook” students at the upper elementary and middle grade levels so they will choose to take the higher level science and math courses and develop critical thinking and communication skills required for students to be either work or college-ready in the 21st century.\\nEngineering Pathways Integrated Curriculum (EPIC) is a specialized math and science path that arms students to enter post-secondary education qualified for engineering majors, or other geotechnical, geological physical, meteorological, or environmental fields, as well as those interested in pursuing education majors in those areas. EPIC includes a strong math and science component. Interested students must commit to the required curriculum of additional math and science coursework as well as enrichment activities.\\nMCPSS STEM Improvement Program. In 2010-11, the Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS) developed the STEM Improvement Program in response to growing demand for all students to experience challenges that bring relevance to and integrate mathematics and science content, similar to those found in the EYE modules. Based on recommendations from the district’s STEM Improvement Advisory Team, MCPSS decided to implement its STEM Improvement Program and STEM Standards initially at the middle grades, before expanding to the elementary and high school levels.\\nIn partnership with members of the STEM Alliance, MAEF developed the \\nSTEM Community Blueprint\\n\\xa0which\\xa0represents the culmination of years of dedicated efforts to support the district’s education outcomes and the community’s workforce development efforts.

The Partners in Education program is a nationally validated program that provides an effective method of increasing community awareness and input into the local education process. MAEF coordinates the PIE program for the Mobile County Public School System.\\nMobile’s Partner in Education Program links more than 1,000 businesses, organizations, churches and individuals, who make an annual impact of more than $2.3 million to our schools in Mobile County. PIE Partnerships have one common theme: improving the quality of education in Mobile County for every child.\\nPartnerships are designed to develop community-wide support for our schools by building an effective working relationship between the school and local community organizations and businesses. There are many resources we can share to provide a quality education for all of our young people.\\nMAEF is the go-to organization that provides a single, one-stop shop for all schools and all industry leaders related to volunteers, speakers, internships, job-shadowing opportunities and other partnerships that ensure success of various programs.

       "  'Pathways (RAMP)\\nAbout Research Alliance for Multiple Pathways (RAMP)\\nIn September 2007, the U.S Department of Labor named the City of Mobile as one of the seven cities to undertake their Multiple Pathways Blueprint initiative, providing $2.95 million in funding to design and implement systems that connect young people who have dropped out of high school to alternative learning opportunities.\\nMobile efforts were focused on engaging youth in career preparation and encouraging them to pursue postsecondary education. In response to a cohort dropout rate of 50.3 percent, Mobile County formed a collaborative of community, business, K-12, and higher education leaders called Research Alliance for Multiple Pathways (RAMP) for Mobile’s Youth.\\nRAMP included the:\\nDevelopment of a system and infrastructure necessary to monitor progress, report findings, engage the public, and drive and sustain the work required and\\nCreation of a blueprint that addresses the needs of Mobile’s students that have either already dropped out of the education system or are at risk of doing so.\\nThese outcomes were dependent on connecting key partnerships and resources in an alliance for maximum impact.  Key partners in our alliance included the Mobile mayor, the Mobile County Public School System, the University of South Alabama, Bishop State Community College, Mobile Works, which coordinates the Workforce Investment Act activities, the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, the office of the District Attorney and MAEF, which coordinated all of the work associated with development of the RAMP Blueprint.\\nSeven years after the RAMP initiative began in Mobile, the work is still going strong through two projects referred to as RAMP UP, including and extended learning and summer transition program:\\nExtended Learning Experience. The RAMP UP Extended Learning Experience (ELE) helps students improve their academic performance by partnering with parents to create a roadmap to graduation. The program aims to elevate students to another ELE: Excellence, Leadership and Empowerment. It does this by:\\r\\nsupporting rigor in the classroom\\nincreasing the relevance of academic content for students; and\\nestablishing supportive relationships between students and caring adults.\\nELE is designed to support student achievement using individualized, intensive instruction supported by Compass Learning, including electronic diagnostic assessments for the delivery of a personalized learning experience.\\r\\nSummer Transition Program. The RAMP UP Summer Transition Program set students up for success with opportunities to participate in self-examination, aspirations and goal-setting exercises, and to develop their high school and career plan. Over six weeks, students in the program receive prescriptive and engaging lessons that target critical skill gaps in grades six through eighth in math that will afford them opportunities to advance to algebra when entering the ninth grade.\\nEarly college/career culture enhancement sessions are planned for students and their parents for discussion on qualifications, admissions, financial aid and literacy, work student, scholarships, internships, fellowships, and hiring/interview process. At the close of the summer, students will present formal portfolios indicating their level of readiness and preparedness for their high school experience. \\r\\nStudents who successfully complete the RAMP UP Summer Transition Program transition to high school with a half credit.\\nFor more information on RAMP or RAMP UP, please contact \\nHilder Wilson\\n.\\nResearch Alliance for Multiple Pathways (RAMP) Media\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

The council encourages student input in the education process and develops young leaders as educational advocates. The advisory council is comprised of 11th- and 12th-graders from each high school in Mobile County.\\nStudents meet monthly with the MCPSS superintendent. Students raise questions and concerns, and the superintendent works with district leaders to resolve every issue and to reassure the students that their voices are indeed being heard. The SSAC has brought student voice to a number of important initiatives over the past several years, contributing ideas and facilitating community meetings. The council has taken on such issues as class size, arts programs, state school funding, alcohol policies, commercialism in the schools and teacher quality.\\nStudents receive professional training to ensure that members of the SSAC are prepared to address these issues effectively. Each year, the council has a weekend leadership development retreat, where they practice teamwork and goal-setting skills, as well as network with other council members.\\nCollege and Career Resources\\nExplore, plan and execute your post-secondary path through online college and career resources, tools and services.\\nThe Equity Project Student Report\\nThe 2016 Equity Project is the third iteration of the student-led project that is facilitated by the Mobile Area Education Foundation.

We thank our keynote speaker, Dr. Gregory G. Fitch, Executive Director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education for setting the tone and providing data that was both encouraging and eye opening. The distinguished higher education panelists provided insight into how they are removing barriers to post-secondary educational attainment. The respondents, Martha Peek and Dr. Charles Nash, both were encouraged by what they heard throughout the day and both shared their sentiments that only through partnerships will educational attainment for all students be achieved. The student panel reminded the audience about the importance of the work and shared their individual stories of challenges and successes. Carolyn Akers issued a Call to Action challenging our community to double the number of credentials/degrees attained in Mobile County by 2030.

       " 'Dear Interested Citizen,\\nThe Mobile Area Education Foundation has served as an advocate and activist for public schools in the Mobile community for the last twenty-two years. Our core beliefs and values remain an integral part of everything we do, especially now as we begin to write our next chapter. We are redefining our priorities, and continuing our broad-based citizen engagement approach that has proven itself time and time again with the success of the Yes We Can movement.\\nMAEF, in partnership with the school district and business and civic leaders across Mobile County, is increasing the chances that students will Graduate Ready for college and careers.\\nWe support our public school system in transforming schools across the county to increase high school graduation rates. We create partnerships with industry leaders to develop students’ workforce skills in Mobile County Career Academies. We help to improve the quality of life in Mobile County by increasing the volunteer base and the number of citizens actively involved in community efforts to improve educational outcomes for children. We create a civic culture of continual improvement across Mobile County.\\nThrough these efforts we have seen the graduation rate increase over 20 percentage points in the past three years. We set the goal to graduate at least 80 percent of our public school students ready for college, career, and life by 2020, and that goal is not too far out of our reach.\\nHowever, the work is just getting started. We will continue to offer programs like the Evening Education Options Program that targets students who are at risk of dropping out because they are over-aged and under credited. By focusing on growing our volunteer base, our Reading Buddy program will ensure students are reading on grade level by the end of third grade. To provide the intervention needed to help middle grade students improve their academic progress as they create a roadmap to graduating on time we use the RAMP UP to Graduation Initiative. Engaging Youth through Engineering will continue to redesign the way math and science are taught in our schools, while introducing STEM to students as early as fourth grade.\\nThe Mobile Area Education Foundation is working to create a better community, one graduate at a time. We know we can’t do this alone. Every volunteer hour, and every dollar contribution, puts us one step closer to improving the quality of life for every resident of Mobile County. I’d like to invite you to become a part of the movement to improve the lives of all Mobile County citizens, children, and future generations of Mobile workers. We’re proud of accomplishments to date and look forward to opportunities ahead.\\nCarolyn Akers\\n MAEF Chief Executive Officer\\nOur Purpose\\nAt MAEF our goals are to innovate for student achievement, enhance strategic partnerships, and to build a community driven platform. We encourage innovative practices and programs that expedite student achievement by providing tools, providing development, and advancing promising innovations. We also partner with area business and industry to graduate students career ready by knowing the recipient, knowing the givers, and evaluating partners for satisfaction, impact, and growth. Lastly, we inspire action to build a high quality public education system by establishing easy metrics, using simple communication channels, and creating a Donor-Centric funding model.\\nOur Vision\\nWe exist because we believe the community’s potential can only be realized when all its citizens have access to high quality public education.\\nOur Mission\\nOur mission is to build community responsibility for improving public school outcomes in Mobile County.

       " 'tact\\nDashboard\\nYes We Can: Building a Blueprint for Equity and Excellence in Mobile’s Schools\\nAbout Yes We Can: Building a Blueprint for Equity and Excellence in Mobile’s Schools\\nYes We Can, one of MAEF’s best-known and most significant initiatives, is a structured and deliberative community engagement process designed to gather citizen input on issues related to the community and the schools that serve it. The process was created by Carolyn Akers and used first in Mobile after the historic tax referendum passed in 2001.\\nThe goal of the first round of Yes We Can community conversations was convened to launch the creation of a genuinely community-driven, student-centered strategic plan for the Mobile County Public School System. Up until Yes We Can, the school district had created strategic plans, but without the insight and from a broad representation of cross-sector community participation. This strategic planning process was different; it was “co-owned” by the community and the school system.\\nBolstered by what was then the new federal “No Child Left Behind” law, and motivated in large part by the Yes We Can Community Agreement that resulted from this community engagement, the Mobile County School Board joined forces with MAEF and the growing community school reform coalition. Together, they developed an unprecedented performance-based strategic plan for the school system, underscoring a shared commitment to making student achievement and organizational accountability their top priorities.\\nIn 2003, at the end of that historic strategic planning process, another round of community engagement was convened across Mobile County to update and revisit the community-driven strategic plan. This new plan, called the PASSport to Excellence, was based on the Baldrige Quality standards, then considered the most rigorous and effective model for reshaping educational organizations to create high-performance results.\\nThen again in 2006, another round of Yes We Can engagement focused on 35 community meetings, starting September 28, 2006, that took place for seven consecutive Thursday nights across Mobile County. Each meeting, attended by stakeholders across a number of sectors in the community—including educators, parents, business and community leaders, students and higher education officials—served two purposes. The first objective of these community meetings was to take what Akers called a “victory lap,” acknowledging the changes made in the community and school system as a result of the 2001 tax increase. The second purpose was to tap citizen concerns and aspirations for what the school system needed to do next to meet their expectations for high-quality schools in Mobile County.\\nIn addition to providing meaningful citizen engagement into education in Mobile County, the Yes We Can brand has become synonymous with citizen engagement that led to higher accountability for results that led to actual improvements in school and student performance. Because the process led to tangible and demonstrable results, cities across Alabama, including Birmingham and Dothan, as well as cities in states across the country, such as Baton Rouge, LA; Jacksonville, FL; and Oshkosh, WI, have used Yes We Can as model for engaging their own citizens in the process of improving their local public schools.\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       " 'ough Engineering\\nEngaging Youth Through Engineering (EYE) is a workforce and economic development initiative created to bring relevance to the K-12 mathematics and science curriculum. The goal of EYE is to inspire, engage and prepare middle school students to take the coursework needed to support the growing demand for highly skilled and technology-savvy workers for major industries located in the Mobile area, including aerospace and shipbuilding.\\nStudents use the Engineering Design Process to apply mathematics and science to solve relevant problems in the classroom and produce the technology and products needed in the world today.\\nEYE includes the following programs:\\nEYE Camps and Clubs. EYE camps and clubs offer engineering curriculum to fourth- and fifth-graders at 25 Mobile County schools. Students attend EYE clubs during the school year and then have the opportunity to continue the EYE program at teacher-led summer camps. EYE camps and clubs use the Boston Museum of Science “Engineering is Elementary” units and are led by trained teacher leaders.\\nMiddle Grades Modules. Funded through a grant from the National Science Foundation, EYE Middle Grades Modules are weeklong engineering units that incorporate science and mathematics. Each module is specifically designed to bring relevance and rigor to existing curriculum, with a special emphasis on mathematics. Each module also provides an engineering design challenge, fosters the development of “engineering habits of mind,” integrates technology and other resources to meet the learning needs of a diverse group of students, and deepens understanding of middle grades mathematics and science content.\\nTeacher Workshops. One goal of EYE is to use the engaging work of engineers as innovative problem solvers to “hook” students at the upper elementary and middle grade levels so they will choose to take the higher level science and math courses and develop critical thinking and communication skills required for students to be either work or college-ready in the 21st century.\\nEngineering Pathways Integrated Curriculum (EPIC) is a specialized math and science path that arms students to enter post-secondary education qualified for engineering majors, or other geotechnical, geological physical, meteorological, or environmental fields, as well as those interested in pursuing education majors in those areas. EPIC includes a strong math and science component. Interested students must commit to the required curriculum of additional math and science coursework as well as enrichment activities.\\nMCPSS STEM Improvement Program. In 2010-11, the Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS) developed the STEM Improvement Program in response to growing demand for all students to experience challenges that bring relevance to and integrate mathematics and science content, similar to those found in the EYE modules. Based on recommendations from the district’s STEM Improvement Advisory Team, MCPSS decided to implement its STEM Improvement Program and STEM Standards initially at the middle grades, before expanding to the elementary and high school levels.\\nIn partnership with members of the STEM Alliance, MAEF developed the \\nSTEM Community Blueprint\\n\\xa0which\\xa0represents the culmination of years of dedicated efforts to support the district’s education outcomes and the community’s workforce development efforts. The Blueprint is designed to:\\nArticulate a vision for STEM education in Mobile County, Alabama\\nDescribe the previous achievements in developing a foundational STEM education movement in Mobile County\\nReport the current status of STEM education and it’s connection to existing education and workforce development strategies\\nIdentify critical next steps and priorities for all stakeholders\\nFor more information on EYE, please contact \\nJudy Duke\\n.\\nEngaging Youth Through Engineering Media\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

We thank our keynote speaker, Dr. Gregory G. Fitch, Executive Director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education for setting the tone and providing data that was both encouraging and eye opening. The distinguished higher education panelists provided insight into how they are removing barriers to post-secondary educational attainment. The respondents, Martha Peek and Dr. Charles Nash, both were encouraged by what they heard throughout the day and both shared their sentiments that only through partnerships will educational attainment for all students be achieved. The student panel reminded the audience about the importance of the work and shared their individual stories of challenges and successes. Carolyn Akers issued a Call to Action challenging our community to double the number of credentials/degrees attained in Mobile County by 2030. Dr. Richard Hayes closed the day by drawing an analogy between our ability to increase post-secondary attainment for all and the athletic system of the game known so well in the state of Alabama…football!\\nFor your convenience, below you will find links to presentations provided by Dr. Richard Hayes and Dr. Gregory Fitch.\\nSponsored by: Mobile Area Education Foundation, University of South Alabama-College of Education, Mobile County Public School System, J.L.

       " 'Pathways (RAMP)\\nAbout Research Alliance for Multiple Pathways (RAMP)\\nIn September 2007, the U.S Department of Labor named the City of Mobile as one of the seven cities to undertake their Multiple Pathways Blueprint initiative, providing $2.95 million in funding to design and implement systems that connect young people who have dropped out of high school to alternative learning opportunities.\\nMobile efforts were focused on engaging youth in career preparation and encouraging them to pursue postsecondary education. In response to a cohort dropout rate of 50.3 percent, Mobile County formed a collaborative of community, business, K-12, and higher education leaders called Research Alliance for Multiple Pathways (RAMP) for Mobile’s Youth.\\nRAMP included the:\\nDevelopment of a system and infrastructure necessary to monitor progress, report findings, engage the public, and drive and sustain the work required and\\nCreation of a blueprint that addresses the needs of Mobile’s students that have either already dropped out of the education system or are at risk of doing so.\\nThese outcomes were dependent on connecting key partnerships and resources in an alliance for maximum impact.  Key partners in our alliance included the Mobile mayor, the Mobile County Public School System, the University of South Alabama, Bishop State Community College, Mobile Works, which coordinates the Workforce Investment Act activities, the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, the office of the District Attorney and MAEF, which coordinated all of the work associated with development of the RAMP Blueprint.\\nSeven years after the RAMP initiative began in Mobile, the work is still going strong through two projects referred to as RAMP UP, including and extended learning and summer transition program:\\nExtended Learning Experience. The RAMP UP Extended Learning Experience (ELE) helps students improve their academic performance by partnering with parents to create a roadmap to graduation. The program aims to elevate students to another ELE: Excellence, Leadership and Empowerment. It does this by:\\r\\nsupporting rigor in the classroom\\nincreasing the relevance of academic content for students; and\\nestablishing supportive relationships between students and caring adults.\\nELE is designed to support student achievement using individualized, intensive instruction supported by Compass Learning, including electronic diagnostic assessments for the delivery of a personalized learning experience.\\r\\nSummer Transition Program. The RAMP UP Summer Transition Program set students up for success with opportunities to participate in self-examination, aspirations and goal-setting exercises, and to develop their high school and career plan. Over six weeks, students in the program receive prescriptive and engaging lessons that target critical skill gaps in grades six through eighth in math that will afford them opportunities to advance to algebra when entering the ninth grade.\\nEarly college/career culture enhancement sessions are planned for students and their parents for discussion on qualifications, admissions, financial aid and literacy, work student, scholarships, internships, fellowships, and hiring/interview process. At the close of the summer, students will present formal portfolios indicating their level of readiness and preparedness for their high school experience. \\r\\nStudents who successfully complete the RAMP UP Summer Transition Program transition to high school with a half credit.\\nFor more information on RAMP or RAMP UP, please contact \\nHilder Wilson\\n.\\nResearch Alliance for Multiple Pathways (RAMP) Media\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       " 't Graduate Ready\\nGraduate Ready is a collaborative initiative of education, civic and business leaders aimed at ensuring that all students in Mobile County are:\\nPrepared for success in college and the workplace\\nAble to apply learning in the real world\\nEquipped with 21st century workforce skills\\nThe purpose of the Graduate Ready is to provide multiple personalized pathways and whole child supports for every child that ensure a better quality of life for every citizen of Mobile County.\\nThe four key strategies of the Graduate Ready initiative include:\\nEnsure high-quality teaching and learning from Pre-K through 12th grade\\nTransform all secondary schools to ensure that all students graduate from high school ready for college and career.\\nEnsure postsecondary access and completion\\nSustain improvements through continued education, business and civic leadership\\nA key component of Graduate Ready is the creation of signature Career Academies at each of Mobile County’s 12 high schools. These academies align closely with the business community and with colleges and universities to prepare students for careers that are growing and thriving in Mobile. Business partner involvement is crucial to this endeavor, to provide opportunities such as internships, teacher externships, shadowing, classroom presentations, and mentoring to students enrolled in these academies.\\nBy 2015, all Mobile County public high schools will have a signature academy and a corresponding business advisory group that will provide hands-on working environments geared toward supporting college and career readiness.\\nGraduate Ready is more than just an initiative of MAEF. It is strategic focus for every program and activity of the organization. It is a North Star that focuses our direction in every engagement, with every partner.\\nFor more information on Graduate Ready, please contact \\nChandra Scott\\n.\\nGraduate Ready: Four Strategic Points\\nGraduate Ready sets four strategic priorities for the Mobile community:\\nPriority #1: Support high-quality teaching and learning\\nEducation research is very clear that the single greatest factor for improving student achievement is the quality of the teacher. Students can never graduate ready for college and careers without having consistent, high-performing teachers throughout their school years. Mobile County has many excellent teachers. But we need an effective teacher in every classroom. To help all teachers, we also need high-quality instructional leadership in every school. And our students need high-quality academic and enrichment out-of-school supports to extend their learning and growth before school, after school and in the critical summer months.\\nPriority #2: Create middle and high schools that prepare students for the 21st Century\\nMobile County has made significant progress with its elementary school performance, providing students a solid foundation for middle and high school. However, in middle and high school, student engagement and motivation drops off sharply. While our graduation rate is increasing, it’s still not high enough. Furthermore, many students who receive a high school diploma in Mobile do not have the skills they need to be successful in college and careers. To ensure that every student in Mobile County is ready for the challenges they face after high school, we must put the same energy and resources into transforming our secondary schools that we put into our elementary schools.\\nPriority #3: Invest in student success after high school\\nA strong K-12 system is the foundation for college- and career-ready young Mobilians. But simply graduating with a high school diploma is not enough. Many students still need support and guidance to get into college and to persist in addressing the challenges they face in achieving their college and career goals. In Mobile County, we lack a coordinated network of supports for students after high school. Such a network can help students access postsecondary opportunities, apply for and receive the financial aid they require, and get the mentoring and advice they need to persist in their goals and, ultimately, to attain gainful employment and promotable opportunities.\\nCollege and Career Resources\\nPriority #4: Support Graduate Ready by investing in MAEF\\nMAEF is the premier community-based, non-profit organization focused on improving preK-20 public education in Mobile County. For nearly 30 years, MAEF has helped to change local policy, transform local schools and engage countless citizens in efforts that have increased student achievement and narrowed the achievement gap for deserving students. MAEF has a proven track record of stewardship and performance and serves as the fiscal agent for all county-side activities related to ensuring that Graduate Ready goals are met.\\nContribute Now\\nSearch\\nQuick Links\\nPriority 1: Support\\nPriority 2: Prepare\\nPriority 3: Success\\nPriority 4: Invest\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

Together, they plan and effect the changes that will improve teaching and learning at all levels, from pre-kindergarten through university settings. The Education Commission seeks to improve the system of education to ensure improved academic achievement for all young people in Mobile County. The spirit of the Education Commission is that of an entire community working together—school superintendents, university and college presidents, business and community leaders, principals, teachers, and parents—to identify and support ways to ensure high academic achievement.\\nThe mission of the Education Commission is to ensure that every child is prepared for entrance into college or a career upon high school graduation. To carry out this mission, the Education Commission is charged with serving as the accountability mechanism that monitors and reports the progress of education outcomes and its impact on workforce development.\\nIn 2011, the Education Commission developed a series of College/Career Indicators (Dashboard below) that provide trending data to communicate whether:\\nPreschoolers are getting a healthy start\\nElementary students are equipped to become life-long learners\\nMiddle school students are prepared for a smooth transition to high school where they will be empowered to make college and career choices and\\nHigh school students have access to post-secondary options\\nTo address the influx of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)-based jobs in Mobile, the Education Commission is working to expand its focus beyond the education pipeline to the workforce pipeline.

Every high school now offers Advanced Placement courses. Focused attention is being brought to ensure that more students are reading on grade level at the end of third grade—a leading early indicator of starting on track to graduation. Likewise, more students are taking the math courses they need to handle algebra in middle school, an indicator that students remain on track.\\nTo ensure every student in Mobile County graduates ready, we are raising the bar. For the first time, starting in the 2014-15 school year, every high school student will take the ACT college entrance exam—not just those who can afford it or those with stated plans to go to college. And, we are working to increase the average ACT score to 21, a nationally recognized indicator that a student is prepared for—and can persist through—college-level courses.\\nBeyond K-12, new attention across Mobile County is being paid to ensuring universal access to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten for our youngest learners, ensuring that they start school ready to learn.\\nThe school district is also working to ensure postsecondary access to students moving forward—whether in structured training opportunities, two-year degrees in community college or associate programs, or four-year university degrees.\\nAs a result, high school graduation rates in Mobile County are on the rise. They are up nearly 20 percentage points in the past three years. The reason is a combination of focus and accountability. For students who are over-age and under-credited, we have established new credit recovery options. We have brought a laser-like focus to the issue, making sure that schools offer more rigor to everybody, not just some.\\nEmployer Impact\\nThe best economic stimulus package in the Mobile region is increasing qualified high school graduates.\\nAccording to the Alliance for Excellent Education: If 90 percent of the MCPSS class of 2012 had earned a high school diploma, an increase of 1,900 graduates, the benefits to Mobile County would include:\\n100 new jobs\\n$16 million increase in annual earnings\\n$12 million increase in annual spending\\n$19 million increase in annual gross regional product\\n$28 million increase in home sales\\n$2 million increase in auto sales\\n$1.1 million increase in annual state/local tax revenue\\nEvery high school in Mobile County is becoming a Career Academy—focused on the five key industry areas in the Mobile region: aerospace, advanced manufacturing, shipbuilding, health, and teaching and learning.\\nThrough partnerships with industry leaders—including internships, job shadowing and mentors—students are being prepared in rigorous academics, such as science, technology, math and engineering. They are also learning the 21st century skills (communications, collaboration, creativity and problem-solving) they will need to succeed in these industries.\\nCommunity Impact\\nIn 2001, Mobile County voters passed a historic tax referendum that put more money into our public schools than had been allocated in more than 40 years. In 2011, citizens refused to step back—they voted to sustain that increased funding.\\nAll the while, people came together from every sector of the community—folks from churches, businesses, nonprofit organizations; parents, educators, everyday citizens and taxpayers. Around kitchen tables, in coffee shops, churches and libraries, they talked about what they want for Mobile County and our schools. If they didn’t come out, we went to them.\\nThis broad-based citizen engagement is unique to the Mobile story. The collective citizen voice enabled us to raise expectations. And it has brought us all together on a path for continued success.\\nCitizens agree that our quality of life depends on the region being business friendly, family friendly and safe. Citizens also know that improving our schools, and the quality of our graduates, can do a lot to improve other factors that contribute to the overall quality of life in Mobile County.\\nBy improving the quality and employability of our graduates, we increase their chances of higher annual earnings. That gives Mobile County the opportunity to broaden our tax base, which can lead to better parks, bike trails, recreation options, and improvements in the arts—all giving families more to enjoy near home. Those factors can, in turn, help to keep our middle class thriving in the region. And a better quality of life in Mobile can help to keep our young people from looking elsewhere when thinking of where to build their lives and families.\\nAll of that can help to increase our volunteer base and the number of people actively caring for and continuing to support our community.\\nImproving Education Outcomes\\nGet Involved\\nTogether, MAEF, working with the Mobile County Public Schools and leaders throughout the community, will create a civic culture of continual improvement by:\\nEstablishing the entry-level skills needed for Mobile’s workforce and partner with schools to increase the number of students who graduate prepared for high wage, high demand CS\\nEnsuring 80 by 20 results by designing, managing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of district and community work systems\\nCollaboratively building human capital competencies aligned with performance-based assessments\\nSecuring funding and align resources to support innovation in career and college programming\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       " 'Dear Interested Citizen,\\nThe Mobile Area Education Foundation has served as an advocate and activist for public schools in the Mobile community for the last twenty-two years. Our core beliefs and values remain an integral part of everything we do, especially now as we begin to write our next chapter. We are redefining our priorities, and continuing our broad-based citizen engagement approach that has proven itself time and time again with the success of the Yes We Can movement.\\nMAEF, in partnership with the school district and business and civic leaders across Mobile County, is increasing the chances that students will Graduate Ready for college and careers.\\nWe support our public school system in transforming schools across the county to increase high school graduation rates. We create partnerships with industry leaders to develop students’ workforce skills in Mobile County Career Academies. We help to improve the quality of life in Mobile County by increasing the volunteer base and the number of citizens actively involved in community efforts to improve educational outcomes for children. We create a civic culture of continual improvement across Mobile County.\\nThrough these efforts we have seen the graduation rate increase over 20 percentage points in the past three years. We set the goal to graduate at least 80 percent of our public school students ready for college, career, and life by 2020, and that goal is not too far out of our reach.\\nHowever, the work is just getting started. We will continue to offer programs like the Evening Education Options Program that targets students who are at risk of dropping out because they are over-aged and under credited. By focusing on growing our volunteer base, our Reading Buddy program will ensure students are reading on grade level by the end of third grade. To provide the intervention needed to help middle grade students improve their academic progress as they create a roadmap to graduating on time we use the RAMP UP to Graduation Initiative. Engaging Youth through Engineering will continue to redesign the way math and science are taught in our schools, while introducing STEM to students as early as fourth grade.\\nThe Mobile Area Education Foundation is working to create a better community, one graduate at a time. We know we can’t do this alone. Every volunteer hour, and every dollar contribution, puts us one step closer to improving the quality of life for every resident of Mobile County. I’d like to invite you to become a part of the movement to improve the lives of all Mobile County citizens, children, and future generations of Mobile workers. We’re proud of accomplishments to date and look forward to opportunities ahead.\\nCarolyn Akers\\n MAEF Chief Executive Officer\\nOur Purpose\\nAt MAEF our goals are to innovate for student achievement, enhance strategic partnerships, and to build a community driven platform. We encourage innovative practices and programs that expedite student achievement by providing tools, providing development, and advancing promising innovations. We also partner with area business and industry to graduate students career ready by knowing the recipient, knowing the givers, and evaluating partners for satisfaction, impact, and growth. Lastly, we inspire action to build a high quality public education system by establishing easy metrics, using simple communication channels, and creating a Donor-Centric funding model.\\nOur Vision\\nWe exist because we believe the community’s potential can only be realized when all its citizens have access to high quality public education.\\nOur Mission\\nOur mission is to build community responsibility for improving public school outcomes in Mobile County.

Every high school now offers Advanced Placement courses. Focused attention is being brought to ensure that more students are reading on grade level at the end of third grade—a leading early indicator of starting on track to graduation. Likewise, more students are taking the math courses they need to handle algebra in middle school, an indicator that students remain on track.\\nTo ensure every student in Mobile County graduates ready, we are raising the bar. For the first time, starting in the 2014-15 school year, every high school student will take the ACT college entrance exam—not just those who can afford it or those with stated plans to go to college. And, we are working to increase the average ACT score to 21, a nationally recognized indicator that a student is prepared for—and can persist through—college-level courses.\\nBeyond K-12, new attention across Mobile County is being paid to ensuring universal access to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten for our youngest learners, ensuring that they start school ready to learn.\\nThe school district is also working to ensure postsecondary access to students moving forward—whether in structured training opportunities, two-year degrees in community college or associate programs, or four-year university degrees.\\nAs a result, high school graduation rates in Mobile County are on the rise. They are up nearly 20 percentage points in the past three years. The reason is a combination of focus and accountability. For students who are over-age and under-credited, we have established new credit recovery options. We have brought a laser-like focus to the issue, making sure that schools offer more rigor to everybody, not just some.\\nEmployer Impact\\nThe best economic stimulus package in the Mobile region is increasing qualified high school graduates.\\nAccording to the Alliance for Excellent Education: If 90 percent of the MCPSS class of 2012 had earned a high school diploma, an increase of 1,900 graduates, the benefits to Mobile County would include:\\n100 new jobs\\n$16 million increase in annual earnings\\n$12 million increase in annual spending\\n$19 million increase in annual gross regional product\\n$28 million increase in home sales\\n$2 million increase in auto sales\\n$1.1 million increase in annual state/local tax revenue\\nEvery high school in Mobile County is becoming a Career Academy—focused on the five key industry areas in the Mobile region: aerospace, advanced manufacturing, shipbuilding, health, and teaching and learning.\\nThrough partnerships with industry leaders—including internships, job shadowing and mentors—students are being prepared in rigorous academics, such as science, technology, math and engineering. They are also learning the 21st century skills (communications, collaboration, creativity and problem-solving) they will need to succeed in these industries.\\nCommunity Impact\\nIn 2001, Mobile County voters passed a historic tax referendum that put more money into our public schools than had been allocated in more than 40 years. In 2011, citizens refused to step back—they voted to sustain that increased funding.\\nAll the while, people came together from every sector of the community—folks from churches, businesses, nonprofit organizations; parents, educators, everyday citizens and taxpayers. Around kitchen tables, in coffee shops, churches and libraries, they talked about what they want for Mobile County and our schools. If they didn’t come out, we went to them.\\nThis broad-based citizen engagement is unique to the Mobile story. The collective citizen voice enabled us to raise expectations. And it has brought us all together on a path for continued success.\\nCitizens agree that our quality of life depends on the region being business friendly, family friendly and safe. Citizens also know that improving our schools, and the quality of our graduates, can do a lot to improve other factors that contribute to the overall quality of life in Mobile County.\\nBy improving the quality and employability of our graduates, we increase their chances of higher annual earnings. That gives Mobile County the opportunity to broaden our tax base, which can lead to better parks, bike trails, recreation options, and improvements in the arts—all giving families more to enjoy near home. Those factors can, in turn, help to keep our middle class thriving in the region. And a better quality of life in Mobile can help to keep our young people from looking elsewhere when thinking of where to build their lives and families.\\nAll of that can help to increase our volunteer base and the number of people actively caring for and continuing to support our community.\\nImproving Education Outcomes\\nGet Involved\\nTogether, MAEF, working with the Mobile County Public Schools and leaders throughout the community, will create a civic culture of continual improvement by:\\nEstablishing the entry-level skills needed for Mobile’s workforce and partner with schools to increase the number of students who graduate prepared for high wage, high demand CS\\nEnsuring 80 by 20 results by designing, managing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of district and community work systems\\nCollaboratively building human capital competencies aligned with performance-based assessments\\nSecuring funding and align resources to support innovation in career and college programming\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       " 't Graduate Ready\\nGraduate Ready is a collaborative initiative of education, civic and business leaders aimed at ensuring that all students in Mobile County are:\\nPrepared for success in college and the workplace\\nAble to apply learning in the real world\\nEquipped with 21st century workforce skills\\nThe purpose of the Graduate Ready is to provide multiple personalized pathways and whole child supports for every child that ensure a better quality of life for every citizen of Mobile County.\\nThe four key strategies of the Graduate Ready initiative include:\\nEnsure high-quality teaching and learning from Pre-K through 12th grade\\nTransform all secondary schools to ensure that all students graduate from high school ready for college and career.\\nEnsure postsecondary access and completion\\nSustain improvements through continued education, business and civic leadership\\nA key component of Graduate Ready is the creation of signature Career Academies at each of Mobile County’s 12 high schools. These academies align closely with the business community and with colleges and universities to prepare students for careers that are growing and thriving in Mobile. Business partner involvement is crucial to this endeavor, to provide opportunities such as internships, teacher externships, shadowing, classroom presentations, and mentoring to students enrolled in these academies.\\nBy 2015, all Mobile County public high schools will have a signature academy and a corresponding business advisory group that will provide hands-on working environments geared toward supporting college and career readiness.\\nGraduate Ready is more than just an initiative of MAEF. It is strategic focus for every program and activity of the organization. It is a North Star that focuses our direction in every engagement, with every partner.\\nFor more information on Graduate Ready, please contact \\nChandra Scott\\n.\\nGraduate Ready: Four Strategic Points\\nGraduate Ready sets four strategic priorities for the Mobile community:\\nPriority #1: Support high-quality teaching and learning\\nEducation research is very clear that the single greatest factor for improving student achievement is the quality of the teacher. Students can never graduate ready for college and careers without having consistent, high-performing teachers throughout their school years. Mobile County has many excellent teachers. But we need an effective teacher in every classroom. To help all teachers, we also need high-quality instructional leadership in every school. And our students need high-quality academic and enrichment out-of-school supports to extend their learning and growth before school, after school and in the critical summer months.\\nPriority #2: Create middle and high schools that prepare students for the 21st Century\\nMobile County has made significant progress with its elementary school performance, providing students a solid foundation for middle and high school. However, in middle and high school, student engagement and motivation drops off sharply. While our graduation rate is increasing, it’s still not high enough. Furthermore, many students who receive a high school diploma in Mobile do not have the skills they need to be successful in college and careers. To ensure that every student in Mobile County is ready for the challenges they face after high school, we must put the same energy and resources into transforming our secondary schools that we put into our elementary schools.\\nPriority #3: Invest in student success after high school\\nA strong K-12 system is the foundation for college- and career-ready young Mobilians. But simply graduating with a high school diploma is not enough. Many students still need support and guidance to get into college and to persist in addressing the challenges they face in achieving their college and career goals. In Mobile County, we lack a coordinated network of supports for students after high school. Such a network can help students access postsecondary opportunities, apply for and receive the financial aid they require, and get the mentoring and advice they need to persist in their goals and, ultimately, to attain gainful employment and promotable opportunities.\\nCollege and Career Resources\\nPriority #4: Support Graduate Ready by investing in MAEF\\nMAEF is the premier community-based, non-profit organization focused on improving preK-20 public education in Mobile County. For nearly 30 years, MAEF has helped to change local policy, transform local schools and engage countless citizens in efforts that have increased student achievement and narrowed the achievement gap for deserving students. MAEF has a proven track record of stewardship and performance and serves as the fiscal agent for all county-side activities related to ensuring that Graduate Ready goals are met.\\nContribute Now\\nSearch\\nQuick Links\\nPriority 1: Support\\nPriority 2: Prepare\\nPriority 3: Success\\nPriority 4: Invest\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       " 'tact\\nDashboard\\nYes We Can: Building a Blueprint for Equity and Excellence in Mobile’s Schools\\nAbout Yes We Can: Building a Blueprint for Equity and Excellence in Mobile’s Schools\\nYes We Can, one of MAEF’s best-known and most significant initiatives, is a structured and deliberative community engagement process designed to gather citizen input on issues related to the community and the schools that serve it. The process was created by Carolyn Akers and used first in Mobile after the historic tax referendum passed in 2001.\\nThe goal of the first round of Yes We Can community conversations was convened to launch the creation of a genuinely community-driven, student-centered strategic plan for the Mobile County Public School System. Up until Yes We Can, the school district had created strategic plans, but without the insight and from a broad representation of cross-sector community participation. This strategic planning process was different; it was “co-owned” by the community and the school system.\\nBolstered by what was then the new federal “No Child Left Behind” law, and motivated in large part by the Yes We Can Community Agreement that resulted from this community engagement, the Mobile County School Board joined forces with MAEF and the growing community school reform coalition. Together, they developed an unprecedented performance-based strategic plan for the school system, underscoring a shared commitment to making student achievement and organizational accountability their top priorities.\\nIn 2003, at the end of that historic strategic planning process, another round of community engagement was convened across Mobile County to update and revisit the community-driven strategic plan. This new plan, called the PASSport to Excellence, was based on the Baldrige Quality standards, then considered the most rigorous and effective model for reshaping educational organizations to create high-performance results.\\nThen again in 2006, another round of Yes We Can engagement focused on 35 community meetings, starting September 28, 2006, that took place for seven consecutive Thursday nights across Mobile County. Each meeting, attended by stakeholders across a number of sectors in the community—including educators, parents, business and community leaders, students and higher education officials—served two purposes. The first objective of these community meetings was to take what Akers called a “victory lap,” acknowledging the changes made in the community and school system as a result of the 2001 tax increase. The second purpose was to tap citizen concerns and aspirations for what the school system needed to do next to meet their expectations for high-quality schools in Mobile County.\\nIn addition to providing meaningful citizen engagement into education in Mobile County, the Yes We Can brand has become synonymous with citizen engagement that led to higher accountability for results that led to actual improvements in school and student performance. Because the process led to tangible and demonstrable results, cities across Alabama, including Birmingham and Dothan, as well as cities in states across the country, such as Baton Rouge, LA; Jacksonville, FL; and Oshkosh, WI, have used Yes We Can as model for engaging their own citizens in the process of improving their local public schools.\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick here\\n to learn more about what MAEF is doing to ensure that all Mobile County students Graduate Ready.\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\n | \\nAbout\\n | \\nOur Work\\n | \\nOur Impact\\n | \\nNews/ Media\\n | \\nSupport\\n | \\nContact\\n© 2018 Copyright Mobile Area Education Foundation.

       " 'ough Engineering\\nEngaging Youth Through Engineering (EYE) is a workforce and economic development initiative created to bring relevance to the K-12 mathematics and science curriculum. The goal of EYE is to inspire, engage and prepare middle school students to take the coursework needed to support the growing demand for highly skilled and technology-savvy workers for major industries located in the Mobile area, including aerospace and shipbuilding.\\nStudents use the Engineering Design Process to apply mathematics and science to solve relevant problems in the classroom and produce the technology and products needed in the world today.\\nEYE includes the following programs:\\nEYE Camps and Clubs. EYE camps and clubs offer engineering curriculum to fourth- and fifth-graders at 25 Mobile County schools. Students attend EYE clubs during the school year and then have the opportunity to continue the EYE program at teacher-led summer camps. EYE camps and clubs use the Boston Museum of Science “Engineering is Elementary” units and are led by trained teacher leaders.\\nMiddle Grades Modules. Funded through a grant from the National Science Foundation, EYE Middle Grades Modules are weeklong engineering units that incorporate science and mathematics. Each module is specifically designed to bring relevance and rigor to existing curriculum, with a special emphasis on mathematics. Each module also provides an engineering design challenge, fosters the development of “engineering habits of mind,” integrates technology and other resources to meet the learning needs of a diverse group of students, and deepens understanding of middle grades mathematics and science content.\\nTeacher Workshops. One goal of EYE is to use the engaging work of engineers as innovative problem solvers to “hook” students at the upper elementary and middle grade levels so they will choose to take the higher level science and math courses and develop critical thinking and communication skills required for students to be either work or college-ready in the 21st century.\\nEngineering Pathways Integrated Curriculum (EPIC) is a specialized math and science path that arms students to enter post-secondary education qualified for engineering majors, or other geotechnical, geological physical, meteorological, or environmental fields, as well as those interested in pursuing education majors in those areas. EPIC includes a strong math and science component. Interested students must commit to the required curriculum of additional math and science coursework as well as enrichment activities.\\nMCPSS STEM Improvement Program. In 2010-11, the Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS) developed the STEM Improvement Program in response to growing demand for all students to experience challenges that bring relevance to and integrate mathematics and science content, similar to those found in the EYE modules. Based on recommendations from the district’s STEM Improvement Advisory Team, MCPSS decided to implement its STEM Improvement Program and STEM Standards initially at the middle grades, before expanding to the elementary and high school levels.\\nIn partnership with members of the STEM Alliance, MAEF developed the \\nSTEM Community Blueprint\\n\\xa0which\\xa0represents the culmination of years of dedicated efforts to support the district’s education outcomes and the community’s workforce development efforts.

We thank our keynote speaker, Dr. Gregory G. Fitch, Executive Director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education for setting the tone and providing data that was both encouraging and eye opening. The distinguished higher education panelists provided insight into how they are removing barriers to post-secondary educational attainment. The respondents, Martha Peek and Dr. Charles Nash, both were encouraged by what they heard throughout the day and both shared their sentiments that only through partnerships will educational attainment for all students be achieved. The student panel reminded the audience about the importance of the work and shared their individual stories of challenges and successes. Carolyn Akers issued a Call to Action challenging our community to double the number of credentials/degrees attained in Mobile County by 2030. Dr. Richard Hayes closed the day by drawing an analogy between our ability to increase post-secondary attainment for all and the athletic system of the game known so well in the state of Alabama…football!\\nFor your convenience, below you will find links to presentations provided by Dr. Richard Hayes and Dr. Gregory Fitch.\\nSponsored by: Mobile Area Education Foundation, University of South Alabama-College of Education, Mobile County Public School System, J.L.
