We strive to provide the best educational advantages for your child and to nurture his/her self-esteem. YSA is a back-to-the-basics school, emphasizing academic learning which includes reading, language arts, mathematics, and science. At Young Scholarâs Academy, staff and parents pledge to work together to help children achieve their academic potential. YSA is both a choice and a privilege; we are strictly a âfirst come, first serveâ educational agency and we abide by the rules and regulations of the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools and the Arizona Department of Education. We do expect that all parents and students will respect and honor the policies and procedures that have been instrumental in our record of successfully preparing students to become models of academic and personal integrity. Young Scholarâs Academy is the realization of the dream of our founder and director, Tonnie Smith; the desire to provide children with a quality educational experience has been the focus of her passion since YSA opened in 1994. A native to the area, Mrs. Smith attended Mohave Valley Elementary, Mohave Valley Junior High, and is a graduate of Mohave High School. Earning an academic scholarship from MHS, Mrs. Smith obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Elementary Education at Arizona State University and later followed with a Master of Arts Degree through Northern Arizona University. Committed to strong academics and a belief in the importance of athletics in a well-rounded learning experience, Mrs. Smith has devoted decades of her life to volunteering in extra-curricular youth sports and absolutely loves the D-Backs! In addition, she is active in her church and enjoys the pleasures of being a grandparent. Our campus is situated on approximately five acres and includes a state-of-the-art gymnasium, media center, art room, and twenty-two classrooms. We offer a teacher to student ratio of 1:12, which ensures individual attention for each child. Working as a team, we challenge each child to be successful while having an enjoyable learning experience."

Calendar | Contact Us Granbury Campus is located inside of the Granbury Regional Juvenile Justice Detention Center in Granbury, Texas. 4-M Youth Services owns the Granbury Center and the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission holds the license. The Granbury Center is a 96-bed secured facility serving both pre- and post-adjudicated youth. The facility primarily treats adolescents with drug and alcohol abuse problems. County juvenile probation departments from the region and around the state place adolescents in the facility. Our school serves males and females ages 10 to 17. Our average enrollment ranges between 60 and 70 students with about 35% in special education. Granbury school staff includes a principal, school diagnostician, registrar, core content teachers (math, science, social studies, and English), a P.E. teacher, life college teacher, math instructional assistant, ELA instructional assistant, and one instructional assistant. All of our teachers are Highly Qualified in their subject areas and are also certified in special education. The campus uses the C-Scope curriculum, and students have access to a full range of computer assisted instruction including STAR Reading and Math, Accelerated Math, and A+. Other technology assisted devices used for instruction include Smart Board, Distance Learning, and hand held devices. The Granbury campus has worked with various local community organizations to develop our âKeyhole Garden Environmental Learning Center.â We will have a link to our project shortly.

Room: Education: Credential: Joined: Hello and welcome to the Granbury campus of the John H. Wood, Jr. Public Charter District. Our campus is in Granbury, Texas, a beautiful, rural town located just 30 minutes from the southwestern edge of Fort Worth. Locals and tourists enjoy a winding recreational lake created in 1969 by the Brazos River Authority. Additionally, everyone can find something of interest when visiting our historic downtown area full of quaint shops, restaurants, live music, an opera house, and city beach. Recreation is abounding with walking and bike trails, fishing, water sports, and championship golf courses. Often on weekends, the courthouse square fills with vendors, shoppers, and bystanders celebrating anything from General Granburyâs birthday to Fourth of July to Harvest Moon. The maximum student capacity of our campus is 96, with the maximum student-teacher ratio being 12:1. John Wood teachers and instructional aides are highly qualified and provide full academic instruction in a technologically advanced environment. Instruction is delivered through a combination of traditional classroom settings aided by a myriad of educational technologies and software applications. JHW Granbury continually searches for better ways to improve student achievement as we prepare our students to re-enter the traditional environment. We offer middle school and high school core and elective courses organized around C-SCOPE, a challenging, standards-based curriculum resource. C-SCOPE is aligned with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS), our state assessment. In addition to grade-level instruction, individualized student schedules provide opportunities for both credit recovery and acceleration, while filling in gaps in learning providing our students with a strong foundational knowledge base in each of their core subjects. Intensive preparation for state assessments is a vital part of our curriculum as well as a structured character education program. We aspire to instill a passion for a thirst for knowledge where our students will become life-long learners. Special programs include gifted/talented, 504, and special education. The Granbury campus focus is âTo inspire students to create a life worth living.â The educational path to get there may vary. The vast majority of our students are preparing to earn their diploma by graduating from high school. For some of our students acquiring their GED is the optimal route as they move on to the next phase of their education and/or career. In this instance, the Granbury campus prepares students to take their GED through rigorous instructional courses. This may be further enhanced with an online study course. Although we are not an accredited GED program yet, the John H. Wood, Jr. Charter District is in the process of seeking this endorsement. The mission of John Wood Charter School is to inspire students to create a life worth living. To help us focus on that mission, the JHW Granbury campus students and staff begin each day by reciting the All-Star Creed: Today I will learn; I will exceed expectations; and I will respect others as well as myself in order to create a life worth living! By starting the day in this way, we remind ourselves that it is our choice to make it a great day! The Parent's Guide to the STAAR Progress Measures can be accessed under the Parent Links on the Home page . A-Honor Roll A/B Honor Roll Student of the Week STARS Party Attendees Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is an innovative and empirically based classroom methodology to promote positive behavior and constructively resolve behavioral issues. Our campuses have used this program with great success. Please take a moment to listen to our Granbury principal, Marc Malloy, discuss PBIS (Principal Marc Malloy starts at the 4:30 mark). Our campus has currently put together a teacher committee to review student performance and achievement for The President's Education Awards Program. The U.S. Department of Education, in partnership with NAESP and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, sponsors the award program to help principals recognize and honor students who have achieved high academic goals through hard work and dedication to learning. Recipients of this award receive a beautiful embossed certificate and a generic letter from President Obama. We wish all our students luck in this and all future endeavors! In our endeavor to do our part in âGoing Greenâ the teachers and administration staff have worked in conjunction with our partner school, Emma Roberson Elementary School, by collecting and delivering 475 pounds of paper, as well as providing 71 pounds of plastic to the City of Granbury Recycling Program. 1300 Crossland Granbury, Texas 76048 P: (210) 638-5600 F: (210) 638-5675 (map) Home Our Schools Afton Oaks Granbury Hays County Inspire Academies Meridell Rockdale Afton Oaks Granbury Hays County Inspire Academies Meridell Rockdale District Info About Us Administration Governing Board News and Events About Us Administration Governing Board News and Events Programs Departments Business Services Departments Business Services Our Plan Employment Parent Links 2015-2016 Parent Survey A Parent's Guide to the STAAR ELL Progress Measure - English A Parent's Guide to the STAAR ELL Progress Measure - Spanish Contact Us Immunizations NCLB Parental Involvement Our Plan Registration School-Parent Compact Special Education Operating Guidelines TEA Graduation Toolkit TEA Graduation Toolkit - Spanish TX Transition & Employment Guide - English TX Transition & Employment Guide - Spanish Texas College & Career 2015-2016 Parent Survey A Parent's Guide to the STAAR ELL Progress Measure - English A Parent's Guide to the STAAR ELL Progress Measure - Spanish Contact Us Immunizations NCLB Parental Involvement Our Plan Registration School-Parent Compact Special Education Operating Guidelines TEA Graduation Toolkit TEA Graduation Toolkit - Spanish TX Transition & Employment Guide - English TX Transition & Employment Guide - Spanish Texas College & Career Student Links Our Schools Purpose Games Student Web Page Texas College & Career Texas Reality Check Our Schools Purpose Games Student Web Page Texas College & Career Texas Reality Check Employee Links Web Mail Web Mail Public Links 2012-2013 Federal Report Cards 2012-2013 HQ Teacher's Report 2012-2013 Self-Eval Comm.

Sun Valley Charter School uses Beyond Textbooks (BT). BT is a curriculum online resource created by a collaborative community of teachers and district leaders to improve student achievement through implementation of proven teaching and learning frameworks. BT is used by over 100 educational partners in Arizona, California, Idaho, Wyoming and Kentucky comprised of 12,000 plus teachers and impacting over 140,000 standards. The BT framework allows for Arizonaâs College and Career Ready Standards (AZCCRS) to be paced out throughout the year, making sure all Essential Standards are covered before state testing. Due to our commitment to maintain a focused program of study, we are enrolling students grades K-8 for the 2016-2017 school year. We invite you to come be a part of the Sun Valley family!

Education done right. A Parent comment ""This school is absolutely amazing. It is hands down the best school our daughter has ever gone to... It is leaps and bounds better than any of the surrounding elementary schools could even hope to be. They have done an amazing job with our daughter and we are thrilled watching the amazing progress she has made. We love all of you that work here and put everything into your job... She has struggled so much at other schools and everything the staff here has done has finally made her love school. You just cant get that at every school... This school has made my child excited to get up and go to school every day!

Alex participated in a challenging Open Epee event that included a number of A, B and C ranked competitors and placed 5th! This allowed him to not only obtain his first ranking, but skip a level and is now a D level ranked fencer at the national level. He has been working hard for this goal since October 2014 when he first became eligible at the age of 13, and the last 6 months have seen him inch closer and closer until he earned it this weekend. He still has one more major tournament to go for this season, and that is on June 19th at the Sunshine State Games in West Palm Beach, where he will compete for the last time in the Youth 14 division before moving on to the Cadet division next season.

The parent pick-up location will still be located behind the Annex Gym, but it will be moved to the corner of the parking lot, near the ball field. (See the attached diagram). This change will begin tomorrow September 8th. Please use the parking spots as you first enter the parking lot, and wait along the fence (near the ball field) for the SIA Shuttle Buses to arrive. The SIA Shuttle Buses are First Student and the Scappoose Route Buses are Durham. Ms. Cindy will be there if you have questions. For your studentâs safety, you will need to meet your student at the curb and walk them back to your car, because there will be many buses coming through the parking lot and we do not want anyone to be hit. Please walk in front of parked buses and not between them, in order for the drivers to see all pedestrians.

The following message is intended for families whose students ride buses to or from school. During the first two weeks of school, school buses may be late or delayed to bus stops, may arrive late to school in the morning, or may arrive late to bus stops at the end of the day. As we adapt and make adjustments to bus schedules, teachers are understanding of this situation and make accommodations. If bus stops times are adjusted, students will bring a note home with the new bus stop times. As always, we appreciate your patience during the first weeks of school. If you have any questions, please call Durham Bus Services at 503-543-3043 . (FYI: If you are a SIA student, you can call the Office and we can try and help you). Thank you. ...

Home Mission The Pioneer Valley Chinese Immersion Charter School (PVCICS) prepares K- 12th grade students for academic and personal success through rigorous study and instruction aligned with the state and federal government standards, augmented with Chinese language and culture. PVCICS's goals are to graduate students with excellent scholarship, high proficiency in Mandarin Chinese and English, plus sensitivity to multiple cultures. PVCICS serves the Pioneer Valley region. School Calendar and Hours PVCICS complies with state requirements for the minimum number of days and hours open. PVCICS operates 180 days a year. PVCICSâs Kindergarten and 1st grade schedule is from 8:30 AM to 3:30 PM. Forstudents in 2nd grade and higher, the schedule isfrom 8:30 AM to 4:15 PM. Students may start arriving at 8:15 AM. The longer day is seen in other charter schools and allows more time for instruction and enrichment activities. Educational Program PVCICS uses a ""one-way"" immersion model, meaning most students will enter the program with no knowledge of Chinese. Chinese language acquisition occurs naturally by using Chinese as the language of instruction during a portion of the day. This approach is becoming very popular because it produces high academic outcomes and bilingual/biliterate students. As a Massachusetts public charter school, PVCICS offers a curriculum aligned with the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks/Common Core. PVCICS students receive instruction in core subjects (mathematics, English language arts, science, and social studies) and in art, music, health, and physical education. Students also study Chinese Language Arts and culture. PVCICS administers the MCAS tests starting in grade 3. Children with special needs are welcome at PVCICS. See the 'FAQ' in under 'Navigation' on the left hand side of this page for additional information. K-12 Program PVCICS's educational program provides students with a continuous K-12 Chinese immersion program that allows them to develop high proficiency in both languages.

PVCICS's goals are to graduate students with excellent scholarship, high proficiency in Mandarin Chinese and English, plus sensitivity to multiple cultures. PVCICS serves the Pioneer Valley region. School Calendar and Hours PVCICS complies with state requirements for the minimum number of days and hours open. PVCICS operates 180 days a year. PVCICSâs Kindergarten and 1st grade schedule is from 8:30 AM to 3:30 PM. Forstudents in 2nd grade and higher, the schedule isfrom 8:30 AM to 4:15 PM. Students may start arriving at 8:15 AM. The longer day is seen in other charter schools and allows more time for instruction and enrichment activities. Educational Program PVCICS uses a ""one-way"" immersion model, meaning most students will enter the program with no knowledge of Chinese. Chinese language acquisition occurs naturally by using Chinese as the language of instruction during a portion of the day. This approach is becoming very popular because it produces high academic outcomes and bilingual/biliterate students. As a Massachusetts public charter school, PVCICS offers a curriculum aligned with the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks/Common Core. PVCICS students receive instruction in core subjects (mathematics, English language arts, science, and social studies) and in art, music, health, and physical education. Students also study Chinese Language Arts and culture. PVCICS administers the MCAS tests starting in grade 3. Children with special needs are welcome at PVCICS. See the 'FAQ' in under 'Navigation' on the left hand side of this page for additional information. K-12 Program PVCICS's educational program provides students with a continuous K-12 Chinese immersion program that allows them to develop high proficiency in both languages.

The 2016-2017 theme for Vulture Peak will be âCommunity.â The overarching goal of this theme is to involve our students in projects that help Wickenburg, as well as support local patrons. We only have two new teachers for this school year, both of whom have already worked in the Wickenburg Unified School District. Joining us will be Christina Gill in 7th and 8th grade English and Laurel Tippe in choir. We are excited to welcome these staff members to the Vulture Peak family and look forward to the fresh perspective and energy they will bring. Vulture Peak has a rich tradition which, combined with our initiatives to meet the challenge of todayâs learner, gives students the opportunity to blossom both academically and socially. These initiatives include the following: Our âMeet the Teacher Nightâ has been scheduled for Monday, August 8 from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Sixth grade students are encouraged to attend from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and seventh and eighth grade students are welcome from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. During âMeet the Teacher Nightâ children can pick-up their schedules, meet their new teachers, tour the campus, collect bus route information, and more! The first day of school is Tuesday, August 9. Please plan accordingly for the first morning of school, ensuring that your child has a stress-free start to the year. This means that you have established a good sleep routine so that your child is well-rested. Also, allow time for a healthy breakfast; make sure you know how your child will be getting home each day, and the lunch plan. Please also plan on joining us for our monthly principalâs coffee. Principalâs coffee provides an opportunity to share celebrations and Vulture Peak happenings. Please make sure to visit us on a regular basis and âlikeâ us on our school Facebook . Both of these venues are ways to keep up with the most current events at school. I look forward to working with you and your children as we start the 2016-2017 school year. Letâs work together to make this their best year ever! Warmly, Jennifer Lougee Jennifer Lougee, Principal Honors Courses â In this program, 7th and 8th grade students are afforded an opportunity to move ahead of the instructional pace and are also introduced to a variety of areas to enhance their learning experience. The honors curriculum is currently offered in English and social studies. Accelerated Math - Students may be placed in accelerated math courses based on a placement test, teacher, or parent recommendation. Algebra and geometry courses will take place at Wickenburg High School. Students taking these courses, while enrolled at Vulture Peak, will receive high school credit upon completion. The placement test has already been given to 7th and 8th graders, and also to 6th graders per parent request. Reteach and Enrich - This program is built into the school day during seventh hour. Reteach and Enrich is designed to provide immediate help for students who did not achieve mastery while providing extended learning opportunities for students who did achieve mastery on a given lesson. Digital Learning Lab - Digital Learning Lab is an intervention class that has been created to target students who scored in the âminimally proficientâ category for the majority of the prior school year. The concept is to provide additional support for students to close their learning gaps. Students have access to the iReady program, Dreambox, and other interventions that are specifically tailored for personalized student learning. iReady - iReady is an adaptive learning program for reading and mathematics that pinpoints student needs down to the sub-skill level. Diagnostic tests and ongoing progress monitoring show whether students are on track to achieve end-of-year targets. Research states that using iReady for 45 minutes a week should produce one yearâs growth for each child. Eureka Math - Eureka Math connects math to the real world in ways that take the fear out of math and build student confidence, while helping students achieve true understanding lesson by lesson and year after year. The team of teachers and mathematicians who wrote Eureka Math took great care to present mathematics in a logical progression from pre-k through grade 12. When implemented faithfully, Eureka Math will dramatically reduce gaps in student learning, instill persistence in problem solving, and prepare students to understand advanced math. We will continue to use Eureka Math as our sixth through eighth grade math curriculum this school year. EngageNY - EngageNY is developed and maintained by the New York State Education Department. EngageNY is dedicated to providing educators across the country with real-time, professional learning tools and resources to support educators in college and career ready education for all students. Our ELA teachers will be piloting this program for the 2016-2017 school year. Character Counts!

We are a K-8 program with a well-developed academic program that emphasizes comprehensive literacy and mathematical instruction in accordance with federal and local standards. Our instructional program is driven by state, local and commercial assessment results, school achievement and adherence with IEP requirements. Our mission is to prepare our children to take advantage of the wealth of educational opportunities that exist for them. To that end, Northwood has hired a dedicated, skilled instructional staff to guide them in the process. Every staff member is charged with the care and well-being of every child. We believe that all children are able to achieve regardless of their socio-economic status, race, ability level or past academic experience. By respecting and supporting our students, their families and our staff on a regular basis, we honor and uphold this belief. Important Technology Information Prior to using any technology at Northwood, every parent and every student in kindergarten through eighth grade must sign off on the Acceptable Use Policy for Technology. This sign off is being sent home today. Please sign and return this form to your childâs teacher. The complete policy is available for your review on our website www.northwoodcs.org. You may also request a paper copy by sending a note to your childâs teacher. B ack to School Night â This is a chance to meet your childâs teacher and hear about the expectations for the year. Join us September 8th at 6:00 p.m. (school wide) in the gym for our Back to School Night. We will have two twenty-five minute sessions (6:30 and 7:00) in individual classrooms.

Sixth grade parents are welcome as well. Please meet in the cafeteria. A Note from Nurse Storino â All 6th grade students need NEW physicals. This is a state mandate. Your child will be excluded from school activities without a completed physical form.

New World Preparatory (NWP) opened its doors in September 2010. At full capacity, the school will house 375 sixth through eighth grade students. NWPâs student body will reflect the communityâs rich cultural diversity, one that includes a high recent immigrant population. Located on Staten Islandâs north shore, NWP is a charter middle school that celebrates diversity and is committed to teaching tolerance. The schoolâs key design elements include: academic rigor and relevance; personalization; strong professional development; and engaging families and the larger school community as critical partners. NWP will provide students with a curriculum weighted in English Language Arts and reinforced language arts skills in all of the traditional core subjects â social studies, English Language Arts, math, and science. The school will have a directed focus on Civic Leadership and Social Justice, emphasizing the importance of improving community life, seeking justice for all peoples and caring for one another. The schoolâs academic program will also include Spanish, health, physical education, consumer sciences, career development and occupational sciences and the arts. NWP will provide structured time to support the social and emotional needs of each student. Students in all grades will participate in an advisory program that will further develop adult-student relationships to support learning and emotional development. Each student will be assigned a single teacher to serve as their advisor, with each teacher responsible for a core group of students.

âThe ArtsâMusic, Dance, Theater, and the Visual Artsâare crucial to the complete education of a child. Their practice, understanding and appreciation are essential to human experience and learning itself. Participation in the arts fosters a balanced and enriched life and engenders a commitment to excellence. The Arts are not simply a means; they are an end in themselves.

And I am doubly sorry that she wonât be here next year to witness something she lobbied for consistently:a school with no cell phones. We are stressing getting all students to work hard in class and increasing overall school rigor.

Students will not be able to take it the same year the course is failed, but will instead need to retake the class over the summer. The cost for a semester of credit recovery will be $200, and a full year will be $400. We want to motivate students to pass courses the first time.

As a non-profit, teacher-led community school, MNOHS has invested in a very low student-teacher and student-counselor ratios. We do this so every student can get the attention he or she needs.Compare our student-teacher ratio (13:1) to the Minnesota average (16:1) or to other models of âvirtualâ learning (60:1, or worse). We make time for each student.The arithmetic is simple: Because MNOHSâ student-teacher ratio is low, we are able to connect one-on-one with each student. Our teachers and counselors develop significant learning relationships with students to help ensure each oneâs success Read more about how MNOHS is different Please enter security code 2314 University Ave W Suite 10 Saint Paul, MN 55114-1863 Phone: 1-800-764-8166 Fax: 1-866-586-2870 Email: info@mnohs.org Sign up for the MNOHS Sampler Course Employment and Internships Share your Talents with MHOHS Outstanding Commendations!

"" 2015-16 Read to Achieve 3rd Grade"" Report for the Magellan Charter School. W elcome to the M agellan C harter S chool M agellan was founded on the premise that learning is a dynamic process that is on-going, interactive, and fun. We wanted this place called ""school"" to be filled with a flurry of purposeful activity and challenging thought, a place where students are enlivened by a desire to learn, and where exceptional teachers bring content to life, skillfully showing how what students learn has meaning and application in the real world. Thank you so much for your continued generosity to our school's Annual Giving Campaign ! We will continue to accept donations to our Annual Giving Campaign throughout the school year. A Brief History of The Magellan Charter School . In 1996 the North Carolina State Legislature passed Charter School legislation allowing for the creation and establishment of independent public schools. These schools would be ""chartered"" by a local or state board of education and be locally implemented and administered. In response to this legislation and a pressing need to provide a different approach to educating students in the middle years, two highly motivated teachers from Wake County, Marybeth Childers and George Coccarelli, filed an application for a charter school that would serve children in grades four through eight. It was their belief that children in these middle grades would benefit from a small, personal, and hands-on environment. They asserted that providing continuity during a time of rapid growth and development helps students maintain their focus on academics-the number one priority at Magellan. In March of 1997, the North Carolina State Board of Education approved Magellan's charter, and for the next six months the Magellan Board of Directors and a multitude of dedicated parents worked diligently to open the school. On August 25, 1997, Magellan became a reality and opened its doors to 294 new students.Today Magellan is home to approximately 400 students. These students are served by a team of thirty exceptional teachers. A familial atmosphere encourages collaboration between the school and our families. Learning experiences at The Magellan Charter School are supported by close relationships between involved parents, dedicated students, and caring teachers. The students' learning, both inside and outside of the classroom, is experiential in nature and reflects real world experiences that will move the student toward being a productive member of our community. To achieve this goal, we believe our teachers must have the opportunity to use innovative, yet soundly researched teaching methods, without restriction to traditional methods. We are a school in which decision making at all levels focuses on one singular issue--What is the best for the education of our children? Master Calendar Agenda. MATH In the News.

Jog-a-thon Parent Info Corporate Sponsor Info 2016-2017 Corporate Letter Lakeview Academy Weekly Newsletter 9/6/2016 Our Mission Lakeview Academy's mission is to develop Capable, Confident, and Contributing members of society through learning experiences which foster growth, creativity and character development. These ""three C's"" are an integral part of the purpose and design of our program and the school takes great pride in developing these noble qualities in our students. Capable: A student who is knowledgeable, inquisitive, and an open-minded problem solver. Confident: A student who is able to approach situations with courage, integrity and a strong sense of self-worth. Contributing: A student who is caring, responsible and proactive in his/her family and community. Our Philosophy Lakeview Academy believes that learning should be exciting and never-ending. Thus, our primary goal is to help our students and their families embrace the idea that learning is a life-long joyful experience which extends beyond the classroom. We strive to create a learning environment that is fun and exciting as well as challenging. In addition to traditional teaching methods, the school's students gain knowledge from hands-on experience, reflection, and real-life application of things they have learned in the classroom. Collectively, these varied learning experiences result in authentic understanding gained from personal knowledge. The arts, technology and community service are fundamental dimensions of this experience. Rich opportunities for experiencing these areas are integrated throughout the school program and provide students with a distinct and useful understanding of the world around them. The school also encourages and provides opportunities for students to use the ""three C's"" to make a difference in their community and become productive members of society.

KIPP WAYS Academy is a tuition-free public charter middle school located in West Atlanta. Founded in 2003, we serve approximately 330 students in fifth through eighth grades. KIPP WAYS Academy is part of KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools and the national KIPP network of schools preparing students for success in college and in life. It is the mission of WAYS Academy to prepare students for top quality high schools, colleges, and the competitive world beyond by instilling in each student a commitment to scholarship, teamwork, integrity, and other âWAYS to success.â We are currently servingGrades 5-8 KIPP WAYS Academy 350 Temple St NW, Atlanta, GA 30314 T 404-475-1941 The academic program of KIPP WAYS Academy is designed to challenge every scholar to achieve on or above grade level performance in all academic subjects. While scholars may enter the school below grade level in many areas, the school is prepared for the challenge of equipping scholars with the knowledge, skills, and scholarly habits necessary for success in an academically rigorous college preparatory high school. The foundation of our curriculum is based upon the Georgia Performance Standards, but is accelerated and taught rigorously to ensure that scholars are prepared for a college preparatory high school upon completion of the 8th grade at KIPP WAYS Academy. Throughout the year, the scholars spend more time in all core academic subjects, providing them with sufficient time to âfill in any holesâ that may exist in their academic skills or knowledge through an âaccelerated spiralingâ instructional approach. KIPP WAYS Academy is a Team and Family that is working towards the same mission. Our culture is closely tied to our school values which are âfive WAYS to success:â When our scholars and our staff embody and demonstrate these values, they are putting forth their best effort on all tasks (perseverance); helping their teammates along the way (teamwork); achieving significant academic gains (scholarship); while enjoying them (fun) and operating with the utmost respect and honesty (integrity). When scholars have internalized these âways to successâ and practice them on a regular basis, they are equipped with both the academic and life skills to excel in any rigorous environment. Dwight Ho-Sang serves as the School Leader of KIPP WAYS Academy. He began his teaching career as a Teach For America Corps member at Dunbar Elementary School in Atlanta Public Schools. Dwight began his work with KIPP as a social studies and language arts teacher at KIPP WAYS Academy. During his tenure with KIPP, Dwight completed the Teacher Leader and Leadership Team training programs and served as both the Lower School Dean and the Dean of Instruction at KIPP WAYS Academy. Before serving as School Leader of KIPP WAYS Academy, Dwight was School Leader of KIPP DIAMOND Academy in Memphis, TN. Dwight is a graduate of Williams College in Williamstown, MA. KIPP WAYS Academy is grateful for the support of the following community partners: KIPP WAYS Academy invites parents to join forces with the school in a variety of volunteer opportunities. Parents are given the knowledge needed to confidently manage and orchestrate various school and community efforts. Those interested in expanding their involvement at KIPP WAYS Academy are invited to contact our Director of Parental Engagement, Jackie Goodman-Cook . KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools is a network of free public charter schools serving students in the communities of West Atlanta, Southeast Atlanta, and East Point.

KIPP Vision Primary is a tuition-free, public charter elementary school in Southeast Atlanta. It is located on the KIPP Vision Campus, along with KlPP Vision Academy. KIPP Vision Primary opened in July 2013 with 100 kindergarten students, and will grow a grade per year until serving grades K-4 in 2017. The mission of KIPP Vision Primary is to empower all students with the character, scholarly habits, and academic skills critical for becoming leaders in their communities and essential for success in top quality middle schools, high schools, colleges and the competitive world beyond. We are currently servingGrades K-3 KIPP VisionPrimary 660 McWilliams Road SE Atlanta, GA 30315 T 404-537-5252 At KIPP Vision Primary, we work diligently with scholars to develop their innate character strengths and to cultivate critical thinking in all content areas. We have selected a standards-based curriculum that supports scholars to dig deeper into the content and who they are while supporting curiosity and creativity. We recognize that no curriculum is an exact match to every scholarâs needs, therefore we make data-based modifications and supplement packaged curriculum resources as necessary. We place a high value on the ability to explain oneâs thinking and we utilize a constructivist approach in most areas. We also ensure that scholars understand not only what they are doing, but also why and how it is relevant in their life inside and outside of KIPP Vision Primary. At KIPP Vision Primary we believe that ALL children are created with a unique purpose and a charge to do great things. Therefore, we are committed to creating a warm and nurturing environment that cultivates in each student a passion for learning, a commitment to excellence and the scholarly habits needed to reach their full potential. We do this through exposure to real life, culturally relevant experiences; explicit character development, with a focus on student accountability; meaningful partnerships with parents, guardians, and the community. Wheda Carletos is the founding Principal of KIPP Vision Primary. She started her teaching career at the former Herndon Elementary School in Atlanta Public Schools. Wheda then joined the KIPP team and family as a fifth-grade teacher at KIPP WAYS Academy. She then went on to serve as curriculum specialist for KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools as well as dean at KIPP Vision Academy. Wheda holds a B.A. from Georgia State University, a M.A. in Public Health from Emory University, and a Ph.D. in Educational Leadership from Mercer University. KIPP Vision Primary is grateful for the support of the following community partners: We are always seeking dedicated volunteers. After making prior arrangements with our Director of Community Affairs, community members are able to volunteer in the school by being a guest speaker, helping teachers file papers and performing other clerical duties, reading to a small group of students, assisting with our extracurricular programs, and donating needed supplies.

Susana Mena âView Bio The mission of KIPP Heartwood Academy is to deepen in the students of East San Jose the knowledge, skills, character, and intellectual habits needed to excel in college and to make positive change every single day. KIPP Heartwood Academy is a free, open-enrollment, college-preparatory public charter middle school in San Jose. It opened its doors to 73 fifth grade students in July 2004, becoming the first public charter school in Alum Rock. By partnering with parents, teachers, community members, and the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District, KIPP Heartwood proves that with the necessary desire, discipline, and dedication, East San Jose students can perform at the same high levels as other students in Santa Clara County. KIPP Heartwood puts students on a solid track to success in high school, college, and the competitive world beyond. Our school derives its name from the redwood tree. The living tissue, or core, of a redwood tree is called the heartwood. When a redwood tree is damaged, it rebuilds itself from its heartwood. 406 students, grades 5â8 80% Latino 19% Asian 1% Other 23% English Language Learners 6% Students with Special Needs 82% qualify for federal free and reduced-price meals 1250 South King Road San Jose, CA 95122 Phone: (408) 926-5477 Fax: (408) 926-5478 Email: kha_info@kippbayarea.org Applications for the 2016-17 school year are now open for Grades 5-8.

Invictus will be conducting a trip to Southern Ohio to take students on a three-school visit on October 20,2016. The trip will stop at: Meet with your teacher if you are interested in attending. The Cleveland Browns generously made a number of tickets available to Invictus Students to attend several games this year. IHS student Faleia Wilson spotted JR Smith from our National Champion Cavaliers in the stands! Faleia definitely deserved the tickets as she had the highest GPA of any Invictus student participating in the Gateway Program with Tri C. She will be qualified for scholarships and membership in some elite organizations because of her work. Invictus Students enjoyed a trip to Cleveland's Federal Reserve Bank on August 30, 2016. The students enjoyed the tour a great deal, and learned a lot about our financial institutions. The staff at the Federal Reserve Bank was impressed with the engaged and attentive students from Invictus. The tour guide let Mr. Fasig know that the students of Invictus asked more and better questions than virtually any of the other schools they had seen. Over the summer, Invictus staff all volunteered at the Clevelad Kids Book Bank. The staff all helped the Book Bank by sorting and boxing books for distribution to schools and the ""Little Free Libraries"" all around Cleveland. http://www.cccvoice.com/2016/03/12/4199/ Click on the link to read about an Invictus Student succeeding in College via the Gateway program with Tri-C.

OAK Leadership Institute is a community school located in Clevelandâs historic Hough neighborhood. OAK is the acronym for âOvercome Anything for Kids.â Serving children in grades K-8, OAK Leadership Institute is a nurturing learning community that inspires and supports young leaders who can define and achieve their own success. Central to OAKâs mission is the recognition and appreciation that learning differences are gifts, that each individual student processes information differently, and that diversity is a component of excellence. Educators at OAK incorporate multisensory activities in the general education classroom to create an optimal learning environment for every student in the classroom to enjoy learning and experience success. At OAK, educators truly know their students, as learners and as individuals. Students at OAK are taught and empowered to make choices, think critically and creatively, develop ownership of their learning, and become self-advocates and agents of change. Through the Peace First movement, students at OAK are becoming the next generation of peacemakers who can create positive change around them. Students are taught to work effectively with others to resolve conflicts, solve community problems, communicate ideas effectively, and form positive social relationships. As students progress through the curriculum at each developmental level, from Kindergarten through 8th grade, they develop the courage and compassion they need to see themselves as leaders and to act with empathy toward others. Highlighted Academic Offerings Student Engagement and Activities Parent & Community Involvement Student Resources and Services Technology Technology is integrated in the classroom as an instructional tool and to help students improve their technology skills.

Bay Haven Charter Academy, INC. What do we believe and what are we all about? We are compelled by state law to teach the FSA (Florida Standard Assessments) which are the controversial Core Curriculum Standards you have read about with just a small number of adjustments. However, we teach beyond the standards and we firmly believe in setting expectations for our learners based upon a powerful work ethic. There is a demand for rigor and a process/product based approach. This is an organization of conservative values and powerful support for our military with the knowledge that not all students go to or need to go to college. Many need to move toward careers that better suit their lifeâs goals. However, our college preparatory program is dynamic with Advanced Placement and Dual Enrollment courses along with a middle school Pre-AP program. We also offer the SAIL (Studies in Advanced and Innovative Learning) Program in our high school. North Bay Haven and Bay Haven schools are consistently (for 13 years) ranked in the top 10% of all traditional and charter public schools in the State of Florida. We have the highest FCAT and EOC (End of Course) exams scores in Bay County every year in practically every subject at every grade level. Please visit our Foundation site at http://bhcafoundation.org/ to learn more about supporting our schools. Thank you. 								There will be no school on Thursday or Friday, September 1st and 2nd, 2016. Please be safe!							 								There will be a meeting of the BHCA, Inc. Board of Directors on Thursday, September 8th at 4:00 p.m. at the Bay Haven campus in the media center.							 								At Camo Dreams, Inc. we are dedicated to providing once in a lifetime outdoor opportunities to deserving children with disabilities or terminal illnesses.

Appleton Public Montessori (APM) is located at 1545 East Broadway Drive, Appleton, WI 54913. We are a charter school within the Appleton Area School District . Our school was started in 2005 to fill a need in the community for an authentic Montessori Elementary School.We started with two classrooms and have grown over the years to have five classrooms. The Montessori method is a child centered approach utilizing multi-aged classrooms. Each of our rooms offer a prepared environment with specific, hands on, sequential materials. Each child contributes to their learning or work plan by selecting work and concentrating on it for up to three hours during work time. Our students programing also includes Spanish, performing and visual arts and physical and environmental education. We have many goals for the children at APM, but most of all we hope they âlearn to love to learn.â No qualified person with a disability will, because the Districtâs facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by persons with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which Section 504/ADA applies. As to facilities, the District will conduct its programs or activities so that, when viewed in their entirety, they are readily accessible to disabled persons. To the extent a program or activity is now held in an inaccessible location, it will be moved to an accessible location upon request.

The Classical Academy Dear TCA Community, Welcome to the upcoming 2016-17 school year, and to our new and improved website! Regarding the school year, I'd like to once again say thank you for journeying with me as we assist parents in helping our students become extraordinary. As always, there are exciting, unique, and wonderful things happening at TCA, and as we approach the first few days of school and beyond, I look forward to updating you periodically, while exploring all that TCA has to offer. And, to help us communicate the exciting, unique, and wonderful, please spend a minute or two browsing our new website, and come back frequently. I think you'll find it to be user friendly, informative, and...timeless. Just like the rest of our amazing school. Thank you again for being a part of our wonderful community. And, WELCOME to the new school year! WE ARE TITANS! Russ Sojourner This is a select listing of events at TCA. To get a full list of all events across all campuses, please see our full TCA Event Calendar by clicking here .

The mission of the Mott Hall Charter School is to prepare our scholars in mind, body, and character to succeed in top high schools, colleges, and careers by becoming inquisitive, open-minded, and compassionate citizens of the world. At MHCS we believe that in order to be successful we must provide a holistic educational experience, tending to the developing mind, body, and character of our young scholars. Only in this way will we be preparing leaders for the 21st century. Under the guidance of a skilled coaching staff, Mott Hall offers a wide variety of after school athletic clubs and teams for both boys and girls including soccer, flag football, basketball and more. These opportunities not only help our scholars stay healthy they also provide college bound skills. Through our core values we teach our scholars the character skills to overcome the obstacles they face to being successful in life. These core values are Responsibility, Integrity, Scholarship, and Excellence. Scholars are introduced to these attributes from the moment they walk through our door and our values are reinforced throughout their time at Mott Hall through our school culture, our RISE Incentive Program, and our school affirmation. Our behavior and discipline approach provides an age-appropriate response to scholar misbehavior. We set firm limits for acceptable behavior and help teach scholars to make the right choices for themselves. When they do not we provide additional opportunities for them to practice the skills they need in small group and one-on-one settings. To foster a learning community free of distraction Mott Hall upholds a strict uniform policy. The policy is strictly enforced, with scholars expected to be in full uniform whenever they are on school grounds. Amendments to the uniform are only allowed for medical or religious reasons. Wearing our uniform each day reflects all four of our schoolâs core values of responsibility, integrity, scholarship, and excellence. Click here to access the uniform website Our after school program allows scholars to pursue an interest and build skills in activities they can pursue in high school and college. These activities include visual art, music, theater, dance, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), Basketball, Football, and Soccer. We are seeking scholars interested in rising to the challenge of gaining entry into a top high school and ultimately going to college. These are young people who are willing to develop the core values of responsibility, integrity, scholarship, and excellence and demonstrate these values by wearing their uniform proudly, completing their homework every night, seeking out help from teachers and other adults when they need it, and developing college bound skills and interests through our enrichment program. If you are ready to rise to this challenge Mott Hall is for you. Each year Mott Hall Charter School accepts 90 rising 6th graders eligible to enroll in New York City schools with admissions preference given to students residing in Community School District 9 where the school is located. All applicants must be residents of New York State at the time of application and must be able to demonstrate residency through proper identification.

The recent California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) scores reflect a âsnapshot' in time of our progress towards mastering the Common Core State Standards, but they donât tell the whole story,â said CUSD Superintendent Eric Andrew. âWe aredisaggregating these results and reviewing our other assessment data to pinpoint where we need to bolster our instructional practice and ensure that all of our students succeed.â He added that schools start this year with the newly adoptedcurriculum in our classrooms, 1-to-1 technology in nearly all grades, and students who are energized by the project-based learning we are able to provide through community partnerships. ""We are going to leap ahead this year,â he said. As of September 7th, the testing company is still printing the individual student reports for our district schools. As soon as we receive them we will mail them to parents. Information about the State assessments and a link to the data is available at https://www.campbellusd.org/stateassessment .

Hope to see you there! Our opening of school was very smooth this year. Thanks to the entire staff for their efforts to make this happen. We were happy to welcome all of our families back for the 2016-2017 school year. It is going to be a good one! SAFETY is our number one concern at Marshall Lane. Please help us to keep your children safe at school by following these important guidelines: We appreciate your help in keeping our campus safe for everyone. Thank you! Have you noticed the beautiful new building adjacent to our upper parking lot? It is the new home of our Campbell Care before and after school program. It contains a fabulous kitchen area and three spacious rooms for our students who participate in this program. Campbell Care is a great place to be! Susan Saba has been the administrative assistant at Marshall Lane for the past five years. She is an outstanding employee who was dedicated to helping all of the families at our school. Last spring, Susanâs family moved to Hollister. While she was hopeful that she could still remain in her job here, that has proven to be too difficult. Susanâs last day at Marshall Lane will be Friday, September 2nd. Our entire community thanks Susan for her years of service to our school. We will miss her and wish her well in her future endeavors. Our health clerk, Michelle Roberts, will be our new administrative assistant. She has worked in the district for the past ten years and has been at Marshall Lane for five years. As a community member and former PTA co-president at our school, Michelle is uniquely qualified for her new role. Please join me in congratulating and supporting her. The clerk job is currently posted. We will be interviewing and hiring a new person in this position in the upcoming weeks. As part of the Campbell Union School Districtâs effort to âgo greenâ, solar panels have been installed on the roof of several of our buildings. This project will be completed over the next few weeks and will begin to generate power for our school. With the new Campbell Care building on site, we were able to convert the old preschool and Campbell Care building into a bigger facility for our youngest students. The interior of the building was completely renovated over the summer and is now housing two preschool classes. Children from 2 to 4 years old may attend. For more information or to sign up please call (408) 341-7127. Partial and full day programs are available. During the first few weeks of school, our staff reviews the expectations that we have for our students. Our behavioral code is called STARS behavior which stands for: Safety First Take Responsibility Act with Integrity Remember Kindness Show Respect Ask your students to tell you what it means to them.

Click HERE for even more information on LIFE Charter Middle School. LIFE Charter School is located inside of North Shore Middle School. LIFE (Learning Through Experience; Innovating Through Collaboration; Fueling an Entrepreneurial Spirit; Excelling in Leadership while building within Community) is a 6th-8th grade experience which focuses on helping students to develop perseverance, professionalism, and creativity through entrepreneurial learning experiences. The middle school math program is challenging and focuses on studentsâ ability to problem solve with an emphasis on explaining their reasoning skills both verbally and in writing. To enrich our mathematics program we have an Arrowhead High School math teacher on staff. Students who successfully pass geometry at the middle school are eligible to earn Arrowhead High School credit for the class. Students at LIFE Charter are engaged in learning through inquiry-based methods. A readers-writers workshop model is utilized for literacy instruction. Genius hour is a âhands-onâ time during the charter studentâs day where students are encouraged to delve deeper into topics that are of particular interest or are a passion for them. Students utilize inquiry-based methods to engage both during Genius Hour and during their entrepreneurial personal finance class. 6 th â 8 th Grade: 6 th â 8 th Grade: The comprehensive program extends into the middle school and features a variety of electives to match student interests, including: art, theatre, choir, musical performances, orchestra, band and jazz band. NSMSâs new STEM lab includes robotics, 3D printing and construction design. Our math program is challenging and ensures that students will meet and exceed high school expectations. To enrich our math program we have an Arrowhead High School teacher on staff at NSMS, which helps bridge the middle school math program with the high school math program. Part of the comprehensive curriculum is our state of the art STEM lab with 3D printing. The comprehensive teachers are collaborative and highly qualified by being certified in the content areas they teach in math, science and language arts. In a digital world, Hartland/Lakeside understands that many students learn well through the vast technological resources offered by our District. All of our classrooms have access to computers and iPads and incorporate many aspects of learning through technological media. Yet, our digital classrooms extend learning to a global venue where students interact with people from around the world. In addition, they are able to explore places and cultures different from their own environment, and learn firsthand from experts and scientists through a virtual interactive experience. Yet, one of the hallmarks of our digital classrooms is that they have become a model site of student and teacher learning and experiences that are shared with other staff members. As an example, digital classrooms have incorporated the use of Apple TV, where students can push their work wirelessly onto a large TV screen and where teachers use mobile devices to share videos and other visual learning cues. Another benefit to the digital classroom is enhanced communication with parents using various technological forms that were not available a few years back. This allows parents to have insights and information into their childâs daily schoolwork and learning expectations. The digital classrooms strive to develop an interactive and meaningful partnership where parents play a daily role with the teacher in their childâs education. Hartland/Lakeside offers onecharter schooland three magnet schoolsacross the K-8 grades. The charter consists of a K-2 fine arts schooland the two magnet schools offera 3-5-community learning multi-grade school, and a 6-8 entrepreneurial school. At Hartland/Lakeside, we understand that children learn differently and that the learning environment can play a role in how their engagement and motivation is expressed. Our charter and magnet schools provide alternative learning opportunities, where students can connect their interests to curricular objectives and extend their learning using approaches that work better for them. LIFE Charter Middle School Instructions for online resources Hartland-Lakeside is a community oriented school district with high quality programs and services.

KIPP Generations Collegiate (KGC) opened its doors the fall of 2011 and serves college-bound 9th - 12th-grade students from Houstonâs North and East communities.The academic and co-curricular programs at KGC provide a college-preparatory experience that empowers students with the knowledge, skills, and mindsets to go to and through college. At KIPP Generations Collegiate we believe that education provides choice for a future.We envision a generation of college ready critical thinkers who take responsibility for their learning and who contribute actively by giving back and paying forward.Our scholars will enter a college or university setting with an understanding that where they are from is very much a part of who they were meant to become, and the realization of their educational ambitions can change the trajectory of their futures, their familyâs future, and the community from which they belong.We will generate graduates who will âbe the change [we] wish to see in the worldâ. Service Learning Citizenship is one of KGCâs core values.To honor this value, we require our students to complete at least 80 hours of service learning activities to graduate.Instead of simply volunteering, our scholars integrate community service activities with an academic study to enrich learning, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen our community.Furthermore, we have at least one week during each school year devoted to service learning activities.At KGC, we believe that âWe Lift as We Climbâ and that our studentâs successes are rooted in the successes of those who came before and after us.As a new generation of hope, KGC will seek to establish mentoring roles with its feeder middle schools, KIPP 3D Academy (North Houston) and KIPP Intrepid Preparatory School (East End). KGC provides a rigorous college-preparatory education with an emphasis on reading, writing, and critical thinking. In addition to graduation requirements set by the Texas Education Agency, students at KGC will receive ongoing support to develop organizational skills and study habits that will enable them to be successful in college and beyond through our Collegiate Pathway.Students must gain acceptance into a four-year college or university as a high school graduation requirement.Our curriculum features: KIPP Houston | 10711 KIPP Way | Houston, TX 77099 | Phone: 832.328.1051 | Contact Us About Mission Past.

America's commitment to self-government requires educated citizens. The goal of a classical education is to instill two virtues of great importance to our republic: wisdom and eloquence. Through broad study of the liberal arts and sciences, students will learn to see what is timeless and universal in human nature and human institutions. Reading old books as well as new, students will engage in ""The Great Conversation"" with thinkers throughout history, and be challenged to move beyond immediate experience and contemporary concerns to gain an abiding appreciation of the true, the good, and the beautiful in life. These fruits of a classical education lead to the highest outcome--wisdom--the knowledge of the world, well-developed ideals of what should be, and the character to act accordingly. Democracy requires persuading others, which is why students must also acquire eloquence. It is not enough to have a view of the true, the good, and the beautiful--citizens must be able to convey their perspective to others and engage in civil discourse to maintain and advance the republic. Challenged to work with original sources and to defend a point of view using logic, students will develop their rhetorical skills at a young age and continue to hone them throughout their education. By studying and articulating ideas aboutgovernment from Plato to John Locke and beyond, our students learn the principles of American politics that enable statesmanship. A ""charter school"" is a public school that is given the freedom to implement a different approach to education than the regular public schools. Charter schools are not religious, and do not screen applicants in any way. There is no tuition. Parents who would like their children to attend submit an application. If there are more applications than there are slots available, a public lottery is held to randomly choose students. Currently, there are over 5,400 charter schools in America, serving over 1.7 million students.

As a public charter school, we receive just 80% of state funding, making this fundraising event essential to our children. Tickets can be purchased in the school office. We learn ways to learn, grow, and lead that contribute to the larger community and invite our best human qualities to shine. Rooted in our local community, we learn in an authentic Montessori environment, growing as conscientious and joyful learners, inspired to lead in the world community. Children are surrounded by beautiful materials and creative expression is woven into each area of the curriculum. Focus on the story of the universe, how life develops, and our history to help develop awe and appreciation. Vast lessons on the solar system, Earth, biomes, continents, cultures, climate, landscape, natural resources, food, and architecture. A rich language environment encouraging self-expression, discussion, and use of a variety of reference materialsbeyond standard textbooks. Hands-on materials help students explore mathematical process, fosteringa real understanding and ability to apply skills in everyday life. Nurturingexploration and courage as a gateway to competence, independence and a sense of accomplishment. Cultivating curiosity and imagination at our amazing universe through discussions, observations, analysis and experiments. Exploration of the environment through the senses while developing a deep sense of appreciation and experience. The Montessori curriculum revolves around a fundamental belief that each child has an instinctive and spontaneous desire to learn . A charter school is a public school operated by a group of parents, teachers and/or community members as a semi-autonomous school of choice authorized by a school district. Attending our second year now, and my kids are always smiling, thriving really. They have learned wonderful social skills. My daughter, once introverted, is now quite extroverted and reaching out to other kids. Academically they have increased their desire to learn and greatly enjoy the studios they participate in, which have been: dance, chess, rocket building, recorder, needle felting, clay molding and Spanish.My children have also learned how to assert themselves and speak in a respectful manner to resolve conflicts with others. It is a wonderful school! Mom to 2nd and 3rd Year Owls and a Kindergarten Dove My husband and I regularly say that moving our daughter to CRS was the best parenting decision we have ever made. The changes that we have seen in her since being in an environment that accepts her for where she is right now and celebrates theunique needs of all of her classmates has been really huge. Learning all of the important lessons for school, but also how these apply to everyday life, and fostering a sense of community and responsibility is an incredible gift. Mom to 3rd Year Hummingbird No other local option would have given Grace the same opportunities to make an impact in her school community. From the beginning of first grade, she felt a sense of ownership in her classroom and school. Children are respected and treated as capable human beings. They are given liberty within limits so that they can make a difference in their own learning, their peersâ learning, and out in the world! Mom to 5th Year Great Blue Heron Please donât hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your interest in our school. We hope to see you soon!

Clear Horizons Early College High School was established in 2007 on the campus of San Jacinto College South on Beamer Road and has continually earned TEAâs highest rating. Students graduate each year with an Associateâs Degree from San Jacinto College three weeks before walking across the stage and receiving a high school diploma from CCISD. Early college high school is a bold approach based on the principle that academic rigor, combined with the opportunity to save time and money, is a powerful motivator for students to work hard and meet serious intellectual challenges. Early College High Schools are designed so that low-income youth, first-generation college goers, English language learners, students of color, and other young people who are traditionally underrepresented in higher education can simultaneously earn a high school diploma and an associate degree or up to two years of credit toward a bachelorâs degreeâtuition free. Themajority of the students at Clear Horizons meet one of the four target population criterion defined for Early College High Schools (ECHS) by the Texas Education Agency (TEA): 1) students are first generation college goers, 2) students are from minority groups traditionally underrepresented on college campuses, 3) students are economically disadvantaged, and/or 4) students meet one of the thirteen Texas at-risk indicators. Clear Horizons Early College High School is a CCISD open enrollment charter school serving approximately 400 students, 100 per grade level. As defined by TEA, an ECHS may only service about 100 students per grade level. Eighth-grade students in CCISD may apply each spring to participate in the lottery selection for 125 seats in the freshman class. All coursework is at the Pre-Advanced Placement and Advanced Placement levels. In addition to regular degree coursework, service learning projects are required annually and internships are required in the junior and senior years.

Our Philosophy Where Performing Is More Than An Art, It Is A Way Of Learning OUR VISION To instill a desire in students to become life-long learners empowered with the ability to have a positive effect on the global community. OUR MISSION To establish a Student-Family-Teacher-Civic relationship that develops and sustains a Professional Learning Community where arts and technology combine with academics and real life skills to educate and enrich the Whole Individual. OUR VALUES PLC Charter Schools is committed to providing a learning environment rich in the arts, where students achieve academic and social excellence while solving real-life problems in a cooperative manner. PLC strives to teach all children the importance, value and worth of: Care for Self: Integrity - Honesty - Respect Care for Others: Kindness - Dependability Care for Community : Civic Responsibility OPERATING PRINCIPLES We believe that every student has the ability and the right to learn. We believe that learning takes place best when educators, students, and parents share a common set of educational values and goals. We believe and are committed to the application of technology as a tool in every classroom. We believe our academic and arts programs will develop the inner disciplines and individual responsibilities needed to live productive lives. We believe the self-esteem and individuality of a student will be developed as their artistic gifts are fine-tuned through various arts programs. We believe that positive interactions and positive feedback from staff to students is the best way to encourage appropriate and desirable behavior and for promoting the development of good habits.

Why Choose Us? The ability to walk into a school and genuinely âfeelâ what the atmosphere is like due to the schoolâs ethos, is critical to any decision making process. We Make Learning Fun Your child will embrace learning and explore their strengths Learning is our central purpose and we set high expectations and have a deep belief in every student to learn and to achieve high standards. Our students are the center of all learning and we aim to provide them with a continuous learning journey where they will be engaged in a varied curriculum with relevant learning experiences and a wide range of learning tools. We are a Safe Environment Your child will be safe, secure and supported We recognize that building character is as important as developing intellect. We have created an inspiring social and emotional learning environment which equips our young people with the skills needed to take advantage of the opportunities and rise to the challenges of our ever-changing world. Our programs help every student understand and develop their unique character strengths the same way that they study every other subject. They learn how to apply these to their studies, and cultural pursuits in a safe and supporting environment. A Balanced Education Your childâs confidence and sense of belonging will increase. Students feel a greater sense of belonging and have a higher self-esteem when they take part in structured learning with diversity. This includes our artist-in-residence program and other activities such as class trips with enriched cultural experiences. In addition, opportunities we provide make for a more motivated and engaged group of students, which leads to a happier and more cohesive school. The benefits of these activities have been extensively researched and students who participate develop higher academic results, better relationships at school, and are more likely to continue on to higher education. Ethos and Values We look out for each other We have continued to develop an exceptional learning environment which provides each and every one of our students with the best possible education and sends them into tomorrow as confident, committed and compassionate members of the global community. Our diverse learning community flourishes within and outside of our campus. Our values of acceptance, respect and inclusion are our primary focus and our cultural diversity is welcomed and celebrated. Pride and Belonging Our students take pride in being part of the school Our students have a strong sense of pride and belonging, enjoy learning and are challenged and engaged. These young people will work in occupations not yet created, use technology not yet invented, however, will be able to draw upon the strong foundations and values that will always be part of our school's strong foundation. Our Teachers We will teach your child HOW to think, not WHAT to think Our teachers have an in-depth knowledge of their teaching areas and a wide understanding of the students in their care. They know the learning styles, interests, family environment and what makes our students tick. They encourage students to accept responsibility for their own learning and teach them how to become lifelong learners, thus setting them on the path for success after their schooling has finished. Visit us in Person Make an appointment today to learn more first hand and see us in action. Phone (480) 951-3190 Finally, while all of the above is important, we encourage prospective families and members of our community to take the time to visit us in person. It is when you attend one of our School Days or take a personal tour and meet our students and staff and speak with other parents, that you will experience our true âfeel,â our culture, and what makes us the school of choice. By visiting our beautiful campus you will witness first-hand the dignity and poise of our students and you will leave understanding our beliefs, ethos and values and the aspirations we have for each and every one of them.

Our Philosophy Where Performing Is More Than An Art, It Is A Way Of Learning OUR VISION To instill a desire in students to become life-long learners empowered with the ability to have a positive effect on the global community. OUR MISSION To establish a Student-Family-Teacher-Civic relationship that develops and sustains a Professional Learning Community where arts and technology combine with academics and real life skills to educate and enrich the Whole Individual. OUR VALUES PLC Charter Schools is committed to providing a learning environment rich in the arts, where students achieve academic and social excellence while solving real-life problems in a cooperative manner. PLC strives to teach all children the importance, value and worth of: Care for Self: Integrity - Honesty - Respect Care for Others: Kindness - Dependability Care for Community : Civic Responsibility OPERATING PRINCIPLES We believe that every student has the ability and the right to learn. We believe that learning takes place best when educators, students, and parents share a common set of educational values and goals. We believe and are committed to the application of technology as a tool in every classroom. We believe our academic and arts programs will develop the inner disciplines and individual responsibilities needed to live productive lives. We believe the self-esteem and individuality of a student will be developed as their artistic gifts are fine-tuned through various arts programs. We believe that positive interactions and positive feedback from staff to students is the best way to encourage appropriate and desirable behavior and for promoting the development of good habits.

We Make Learning Fun Your child will embrace learning and explore their strengths Learning is our central purpose and we set high expectations and have a deep belief in every student to learn and to achieve high standards. Our students are the center of all learning and we aim to provide them with a continuous learning journey where they will be engaged in a varied curriculum with relevant learning experiences and a wide range of learning tools. We are a Safe Environment Your child will be safe, secure and supported We recognize that building character is as important as developing intellect. We have created an inspiring social and emotional learning environment which equips our young people with the skills needed to take advantage of the opportunities and rise to the challenges of our ever-changing world. Our programs help every student understand and develop their unique character strengths the same way that they study every other subject. They learn how to apply these to their studies, and cultural pursuits in a safe and supporting environment. A Balanced Education Your childâs confidence and sense of belonging will increase. Students feel a greater sense of belonging and have a higher self-esteem when they take part in structured learning with diversity. This includes our artist-in-residence program and other activities such as class trips with enriched cultural experiences. In addition, opportunities we provide make for a more motivated and engaged group of students, which leads to a happier and more cohesive school. The benefits of these activities have been extensively researched and students who participate develop higher academic results, better relationships at school, and are more likely to continue on to higher education. Ethos and Values We look out for each other We have continued to develop an exceptional learning environment which provides each and every one of our students with the best possible education and sends them into tomorrow as confident, committed and compassionate members of the global community. Our diverse learning community flourishes within and outside of our campus. Our values of acceptance, respect and inclusion are our primary focus and our cultural diversity is welcomed and celebrated. Pride and Belonging Our students take pride in being part of the school Our students have a strong sense of pride and belonging, enjoy learning and are challenged and engaged. These young people will work in occupations not yet created, use technology not yet invented, however, will be able to draw upon the strong foundations and values that will always be part of our school's strong foundation. Our Teachers We will teach your child HOW to think, not WHAT to think Our teachers have an in-depth knowledge of their teaching areas and a wide understanding of the students in their care. They know the learning styles, interests, family environment and what makes our students tick. They encourage students to accept responsibility for their own learning and teach them how to become lifelong learners, thus setting them on the path for success after their schooling has finished.
