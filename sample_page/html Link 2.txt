Students at the Charter School customize their education using our virtual curriculum and design a flexible attendance schedule to meet their individual needs. In 2013, the Charter School opened its doors to students in the 9th through 12th grade. Our extended hours of operation allow students the flexibility to work during the day and complete their coursework by taking advantage of our nighttime hours.  Our major advantage over other online schools is our faculty and staff. By employing a full time school counselor, English teacher, Math teacher, Work Based Learning Coordinator and Lab Specialist, students can ask questions and receive individualized attention.
