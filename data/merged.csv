We strive to provide the best educational advantages for your child and to nurture his/her self-esteem. YSA is a back-to-the-basics school, emphasizing academic learning which includes reading, language arts, mathematics, and science. At Young Scholarâs Academy, staff and parents pledge to work together to help children achieve their academic potential. YSA is both a choice and a privilege; we are strictly a âfirst come, first serveâ educational agency and we abide by the rules and regulations of the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools and the Arizona Department of Education. We do expect that all parents and students will respect and honor the policies and procedures that have been instrumental in our record of successfully preparing students to become models of academic and personal integrity. Young Scholarâs Academy is the realization of the dream of our founder and director, Tonnie Smith; the desire to provide children with a quality educational experience has been the focus of her passion since YSA opened in 1994. A native to the area, Mrs. Smith attended Mohave Valley Elementary, Mohave Valley Junior High, and is a graduate of Mohave High School. Earning an academic scholarship from MHS, Mrs. Smith obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Elementary Education at Arizona State University and later followed with a Master of Arts Degree through Northern Arizona University. Committed to strong academics and a belief in the importance of athletics in a well-rounded learning experience, Mrs. Smith has devoted decades of her life to volunteering in extra-curricular youth sports and absolutely loves the D-Backs! In addition, she is active in her church and enjoys the pleasures of being a grandparent. Our campus is situated on approximately five acres and includes a state-of-the-art gymnasium, media center, art room, and twenty-two classrooms. We offer a teacher to student ratio of 1:12, which ensures individual attention for each child. Working as a team, we challenge each child to be successful while having an enjoyable learning experience."

The Granbury Center is a 96-bed secured facility serving both pre- and post-adjudicated youth. The facility primarily treats adolescents with drug and alcohol abuse problems. County juvenile probation departments from the region and around the state place adolescents in the facility. Our school serves males and females ages 10 to 17. Our average enrollment ranges between 60 and 70 students with about 35% in special education. Granbury school staff includes a principal, school diagnostician, registrar, core content teachers (math, science, social studies, and English), a P.E. teacher, life college teacher, math instructional assistant, ELA instructional assistant, and one instructional assistant. All of our teachers are Highly Qualified in their subject areas and are also certified in special education. The campus uses the C-Scope curriculum, and students have access to a full range of computer assisted instruction including STAR Reading and Math, Accelerated Math, and A+. Other technology assisted devices used for instruction include Smart Board, Distance Learning, and hand held devices. The Granbury campus has worked with various local community organizations to develop our âKeyhole Garden Environmental Learning Center.â We will have a link to our project shortly. Marc Malloy Principal (210) 638.5601 Principal Ext. Room: Education: Credential: Joined: Michell Shewmake Registrar (210) 638.5600 Registrar Ext. Room: Education: Credential: Joined: Hello and welcome to the Granbury campus of the John H. Wood, Jr. Public Charter District. Our campus is in Granbury, Texas, a beautiful, rural town located just 30 minutes from the southwestern edge of Fort Worth. Locals and tourists enjoy a winding recreational lake created in 1969 by the Brazos River Authority. Additionally, everyone can find something of interest when visiting our historic downtown area full of quaint shops, restaurants, live music, an opera house, and city beach. Recreation is abounding with walking and bike trails, fishing, water sports, and championship golf courses. Often on weekends, the courthouse square fills with vendors, shoppers, and bystanders celebrating anything from General Granburyâs birthday to Fourth of July to Harvest Moon. The maximum student capacity of our campus is 96, with the maximum student-teacher ratio being 12:1. John Wood teachers and instructional aides are highly qualified and provide full academic instruction in a technologically advanced environment. Instruction is delivered through a combination of traditional classroom settings aided by a myriad of educational technologies and software applications. JHW Granbury continually searches for better ways to improve student achievement as we prepare our students to re-enter the traditional environment. We offer middle school and high school core and elective courses organized around C-SCOPE, a challenging, standards-based curriculum resource. C-SCOPE is aligned with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS), our state assessment. In addition to grade-level instruction, individualized student schedules provide opportunities for both credit recovery and acceleration, while filling in gaps in learning providing our students with a strong foundational knowledge base in each of their core subjects. Intensive preparation for state assessments is a vital part of our curriculum as well as a structured character education program. We aspire to instill a passion for a thirst for knowledge where our students will become life-long learners. Special programs include gifted/talented, 504, and special education. The Granbury campus focus is âTo inspire students to create a life worth living.â The educational path to get there may vary. The vast majority of our students are preparing to earn their diploma by graduating from high school. For some of our students acquiring their GED is the optimal route as they move on to the next phase of their education and/or career. In this instance, the Granbury campus prepares students to take their GED through rigorous instructional courses. This may be further enhanced with an online study course. Although we are not an accredited GED program yet, the John H. Wood, Jr. Charter District is in the process of seeking this endorsement. The mission of John Wood Charter School is to inspire students to create a life worth living. To help us focus on that mission, the JHW Granbury campus students and staff begin each day by reciting the All-Star Creed: Today I will learn; I will exceed expectations; and I will respect others as well as myself in order to create a life worth living! By starting the day in this way, we remind ourselves that it is our choice to make it a great day! The Parent's Guide to the STAAR Progress Measures can be accessed under the Parent Links on the . (PBIS) is an innovative and empirically based classroom methodology to promote positive behavior and constructively resolve behavioral issues. Our campuses have used this program with great success. Please take a moment to to our Granbury principal, Marc Malloy, discuss PBIS (Principal Marc Malloy starts at the 4:30 mark). Our campus has currently put together a teacher committee to review student performance and achievement for The President's Education Awards Program. The U.S. Department of Education, in partnership with NAESP and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, sponsors the award program to help principals recognize and honor students who have achieved high academic goals through hard work and dedication to learning. Recipients of this award receive a beautiful embossed certificate and a generic letter from President Obama. We wish all our students luck in this and all future endeavors! In our endeavor to do our part in âGoing Greenâ the teachers and administration staff have worked in conjunction with our partner school, Emma Roberson Elementary School, by collecting and delivering 475 pounds of paper, as well as providing 71 pounds of plastic to the City of Granbury Recycling Program. 1300 Crossland Granbury, Texas 76048 P: (210) 638-5600 F: (210) 638-5675 Daniel R.

They have done an amazing job with our daughter and we are thrilled watching the amazing progress she has made. We love all of you that work here and put everything into your job...

Arts for Life! annually awards $2,000 scholarships to 25 graduating high school seniors in Florida who demonstrate excellence in creative writing, dance, drama, music or visual art. Launched by former First Lady Columba Bush in 1999, the program has awarded scholarships to more than 400 gifted high school seniors. We are very proud to announce that one of our Arts Conservatory Seniors from our Dance Program - Kiara Miller was one of the 25 to be awarded a scholarship (the only recipient in the dance category). Congratulations to 8th Grader, Alex Cardenas! Alex participated in a challenging Open Epee event that included a number of A, B and C ranked competitors and placed 5th! This allowed him to not only obtain his first ranking, but skip a level and is now a D level ranked fencer at the national level. He has been working hard for this goal since October 2014 when he first became eligible at the age of 13, and the last 6 months have seen him inch closer and closer until he earned it this weekend.

Hello SIA Parents, Due to the congestion with SIA parent pick-up and SMS route buses, all located under the breezeway of the Annex Gym, we have decided to relocate the location of SIA parent pick-ups. The parent pick-up location will still be located behind the Annex Gym, but it will be moved to the corner of the parking lot, near the ball field. (See the attached diagram). This change will begin tomorrow September 8th. Please use the parking spots as you first enter the parking lot, and wait along the fence (near the ball field) for the SIA Shuttle Buses to arrive. The SIA Shuttle Buses are First Student and the Scappoose Route Buses are Durham. Ms. Cindy will be there if you have questions. For your studentâs safety, you will need to meet your student at the curb and walk them back to your car, because there will be many buses coming through the parking lot and we do not want anyone to be hit. Please walk in front of parked buses and not between them, in order for the drivers to see all pedestrians.

Vulture Peak has a rich tradition which, combined with our initiatives to meet the challenge of todayâs learner, gives students the opportunity to blossom both academically and socially. These initiatives include the following: Our âMeet the Teacher Nightâ has been scheduled for Monday, August 8 from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Sixth grade students are encouraged to attend from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and seventh and eighth grade students are welcome from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. During âMeet the Teacher Nightâ children can pick-up their schedules, meet their new teachers, tour the campus, collect bus route information, and more! The first day of school is Tuesday, August 9. Please plan accordingly for the first morning of school, ensuring that your child has a stress-free start to the year. This means that you have established a good sleep routine so that your child is well-rested. Also, allow time for a healthy breakfast; make sure you know how your child will be getting home each day, and the lunch plan. Please also plan on joining us for our monthly principalâs coffee.

The honors curriculum is currently offered in English and social studies. Accelerated Math - Students may be placed in accelerated math courses based on a placement test, teacher, or parent recommendation. Algebra and geometry courses will take place at Wickenburg High School. Students taking these courses, while enrolled at Vulture Peak, will receive high school credit upon completion. The placement test has already been given to 7th and 8th graders, and also to 6th graders per parent request. Reteach and Enrich - This program is built into the school day during seventh hour. Reteach and Enrich is designed to provide immediate help for students who did not achieve mastery while providing extended learning opportunities for students who did achieve mastery on a given lesson. Digital Learning Lab - Digital Learning Lab is an intervention class that has been created to target students who scored in the âminimally proficientâ category for the majority of the prior school year. The concept is to provide additional support for students to close their learning gaps. Students have access to the iReady program, Dreambox, and other interventions that are specifically tailored for personalized student learning. iReady - iReady is an adaptive learning program for reading and mathematics that pinpoints student needs down to the sub-skill level. Diagnostic tests and ongoing progress monitoring show whether students are on track to achieve end-of-year targets. Research states that using iReady for 45 minutes a week should produce one yearâs growth for each child. Eureka Math - Eureka Math connects math to the real world in ways that take the fear out of math and build student confidence, while helping students achieve true understanding lesson by lesson and year after year. The team of teachers and mathematicians who wrote Eureka Math took great care to present mathematics in a logical progression from pre-k through grade 12. When implemented faithfully, Eureka Math will dramatically reduce gaps in student learning, instill persistence in problem solving, and prepare students to understand advanced math. We will continue to use Eureka Math as our sixth through eighth grade math curriculum this school year. EngageNY - EngageNY is developed and maintained by the New York State Education Department. EngageNY is dedicated to providing educators across the country with real-time, professional learning tools and resources to support educators in college and career ready education for all students.

We will continue to use Eureka Math as our sixth through eighth grade math curriculum this school year. EngageNY - EngageNY is developed and maintained by the New York State Education Department. EngageNY is dedicated to providing educators across the country with real-time, professional learning tools and resources to support educators in college and career ready education for all students. Our ELA teachers will be piloting this program for the 2016-2017 school year."

If you know of someone who would like to work with our children, please ask them to notify Mrs. Friedman at pfriedman@northwoodcs.org. Welcome News The Northwood Academy Charter School (NACS) began operation in September of 2005. We are a K-8 program with a well-developed academic program that emphasizes comprehensive literacy and mathematical instruction in accordance with federal and local standards. Our instructional program is driven by state, local and commercial assessment results, school achievement and adherence with IEP requirements. Our mission is to prepare our children to take advantage of the wealth of educational opportunities that exist for them. To that end, Northwood has hired a dedicated, skilled instructional staff to guide them in the process. Every staff member is charged with the care and well-being of every child. We believe that all children are able to achieve regardless of their socio-economic status, race, ability level or past academic experience. By respecting and supporting our students, their families and our staff on a regular basis, we honor and uphold this belief.

We make time for each student.The arithmetic is simple: Because MNOHSâ student-teacher ratio is low, we are able to connect one-on-one with each student.

A Brief History of The Magellan Charter School . In 1996 the North Carolina State Legislature passed Charter School legislation allowing for the creation and establishment of independent public schools. These schools would be ""chartered"" by a local or state board of education and be locally implemented and administered. In response to this legislation and a pressing need to provide a different approach to educating students in the middle years, two highly motivated teachers from Wake County, Marybeth Childers and George Coccarelli, filed an application for a charter school that would serve children in grades four through eight. It was their belief that children in these middle grades would benefit from a small, personal, and hands-on environment. They asserted that providing continuity during a time of rapid growth and development helps students maintain their focus on academics-the number one priority at Magellan. In March of 1997, the North Carolina State Board of Education approved Magellan's charter, and for the next six months the Magellan Board of Directors and a multitude of dedicated parents worked diligently to open the school. On August 25, 1997, Magellan became a reality and opened its doors to 294 new students.Today Magellan is home to approximately 400 students. These students are served by a team of thirty exceptional teachers. A familial atmosphere encourages collaboration between the school and our families. Learning experiences at The Magellan Charter School are supported by close relationships between involved parents, dedicated students, and caring teachers. The students' learning, both inside and outside of the classroom, is experiential in nature and reflects real world experiences that will move the student toward being a productive member of our community. To achieve this goal, we believe our teachers must have the opportunity to use innovative, yet soundly researched teaching methods, without restriction to traditional methods.

These ""three C's"" are an integral part of the purpose and design of our program and the school takes great pride in developing these noble qualities in our students. Capable: A student who is knowledgeable, inquisitive, and an open-minded problem solver. Confident: A student who is able to approach situations with courage, integrity and a strong sense of self-worth. Contributing: A student who is caring, responsible and proactive in his/her family and community. Our Philosophy Lakeview Academy believes that learning should be exciting and never-ending. Thus, our primary goal is to help our students and their families embrace the idea that learning is a life-long joyful experience which extends beyond the classroom. We strive to create a learning environment that is fun and exciting as well as challenging. In addition to traditional teaching methods, the school's students gain knowledge from hands-on experience, reflection, and real-life application of things they have learned in the classroom. Collectively, these varied learning experiences result in authentic understanding gained from personal knowledge. The arts, technology and community service are fundamental dimensions of this experience. Rich opportunities for experiencing these areas are integrated throughout the school program and provide students with a distinct and useful understanding of the world around them. The school also encourages and provides opportunities for students to use the ""three C's"" to make a difference in their community and become productive members of society.

Founded in 2003, we serve approximately 330 students in fifth through eighth grades. KIPP WAYS Academy is part of KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools and the national KIPP network of schools preparing students for success in college and in life. It is the mission of WAYS Academy to prepare students for top quality high schools, colleges, and the competitive world beyond by instilling in each student a commitment to scholarship, teamwork, integrity, and other âWAYS to success.â We are currently servingGrades 5-8 KIPP WAYS Academy T The academic program of KIPP WAYS Academy is designed to challenge every scholar to achieve on or above grade level performance in all academic subjects. While scholars may enter the school below grade level in many areas, the school is prepared for the challenge of equipping scholars with the knowledge, skills, and scholarly habits necessary for success in an academically rigorous college preparatory high school. The foundation of our curriculum is based upon the Georgia Performance Standards, but is accelerated and taught rigorously to ensure that scholars are prepared for a college preparatory high school upon completion of the 8th grade at KIPP WAYS Academy. Throughout the year, the scholars spend more time in all core academic subjects, providing them with sufficient time to âfill in any holesâ that may exist in their academic skills or knowledge through an âaccelerated spiralingâ instructional approach. KIPP WAYS Academy is a Team and Family that is working towards the same mission. Our culture is closely tied to our school values which are âfive WAYS to success:â When our scholars and our staff embody and demonstrate these values, they are putting forth their best effort on all tasks (perseverance); helping their teammates along the way (teamwork); achieving significant academic gains (scholarship); while enjoying them (fun) and operating with the utmost respect and honesty (integrity). When scholars have internalized these âways to successâ and practice them on a regular basis, they are equipped with both the academic and life skills to excel in any rigorous environment. Dwight Ho-Sang serves as the School Leader of KIPP WAYS Academy. He began his teaching career as a Teach For America Corps member at Dunbar Elementary School in Atlanta Public Schools. Dwight began his work with KIPP as a social studies and language arts teacher at KIPP WAYS Academy. During his tenure with KIPP, Dwight completed the Teacher Leader and Leadership Team training programs and served as both the Lower School Dean and the Dean of Instruction at KIPP WAYS Academy. Before serving as School Leader of KIPP WAYS Academy, Dwight was School Leader of KIPP DIAMOND Academy in Memphis, TN. Dwight is a graduate of Williams College in Williamstown, MA. KIPP WAYS Academy is grateful for the support of the following community partners: KIPP WAYS Academy invites parents to join forces with the school in a variety of volunteer opportunities. Parents are given the knowledge needed to confidently manage and orchestrate various school and community efforts.

It is located on the KIPP Vision Campus, along with KlPP Vision Academy. KIPP Vision Primary opened in July 2013 with 100 kindergarten students, and will grow a grade per year until serving grades K-4 in 2017. The mission of KIPP Vision Primary is to empower all students with the character, scholarly habits, and academic skills critical for becoming leaders in their communities and essential for success in top quality middle schools, high schools, colleges and the competitive world beyond. We are currently servingGrades K-3 KIPP VisionPrimary T At KIPP Vision Primary, we work diligently with scholars to develop their innate character strengths and to cultivate critical thinking in all content areas. We have selected a standards-based curriculum that supports scholars to dig deeper into the content and who they are while supporting curiosity and creativity. We recognize that no curriculum is an exact match to every scholarâs needs, therefore we make data-based modifications and supplement packaged curriculum resources as necessary. We place a high value on the ability to explain oneâs thinking and we utilize a constructivist approach in most areas. We also ensure that scholars understand not only what they are doing, but also why and how it is relevant in their life inside and outside of KIPP Vision Primary. At KIPP Vision Primary we believe that ALL children are created with a unique purpose and a charge to do great things. Therefore, we are committed to creating a warm and nurturing environment that cultivates in each student a passion for learning, a commitment to excellence and the scholarly habits needed to reach their full potential. We do this through exposure to real life, culturally relevant experiences; explicit character development, with a focus on student accountability; meaningful partnerships with parents, guardians, and the community. Wheda Carletos is the founding Principal of KIPP Vision Primary. She started her teaching career at the former Herndon Elementary School in Atlanta Public Schools. Wheda then joined the KIPP team and family as a fifth-grade teacher at KIPP WAYS Academy. She then went on to serve as curriculum specialist for KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools as well as dean at KIPP Vision Academy. Wheda holds a B.A. from Georgia State University, a M.A. in Public Health from Emory University, and a Ph.D. in Educational Leadership from Mercer University. KIPP Vision Primary is grateful for the support of the following community partners: We are always seeking dedicated volunteers. After making prior arrangements with our Director of Community Affairs, community members are able to volunteer in the school by being a guest speaker, helping teachers file papers and performing other clerical duties, reading to a small group of students, assisting with our extracurricular programs, and donating needed supplies. KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools is a network of free public charter schools serving students in the communities of West Atlanta, Southeast Atlanta, and East Point. Enrollment is open to all students; any student who qualifies for public school within Atlanta Public Schools or Fulton County Schools qualifies for KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools.

The trip will stop at: Meet with your teacher if you are interested in attending. The Cleveland Browns generously made a number of tickets available to Invictus Students to attend several games this year. IHS student Faleia Wilson spotted JR Smith from our National Champion Cavaliers in the stands! Faleia definitely deserved the tickets as she had the highest GPA of any Invictus student participating in the Gateway Program with Tri C. She will be qualified for scholarships and membership in some elite organizations because of her work. Invictus Students enjoyed a trip to Cleveland's Federal Reserve Bank on August 30, 2016. The students enjoyed the tour a great deal, and learned a lot about our financial institutions. The staff at the Federal Reserve Bank was impressed with the engaged and attentive students from Invictus. The tour guide let Mr. Fasig know that the students of Invictus asked more and better questions than virtually any of the other schools they had seen. Over the summer, Invictus staff all volunteered at the Clevelad Kids Book Bank. The staff all helped the Book Bank by sorting and boxing books for distribution to schools and the ""Little Free Libraries"" all around Cleveland.

OAK is the acronym for âOvercome Anything for Kids.â Serving children in grades K-8, OAK Leadership Institute is a nurturing learning community that inspires and supports young leaders who can define and achieve their own success. Central to OAKâs mission is the recognition and appreciation that learning differences are gifts, that each individual student processes information differently, and that diversity is a component of excellence. Educators at OAK incorporate multisensory activities in the general education classroom to create an optimal learning environment for every student in the classroom to enjoy learning and experience success. At OAK, educators truly know their students, as learners and as individuals. Students at OAK are taught and empowered to make choices, think critically and creatively, develop ownership of their learning, and become self-advocates and agents of change. Through the Peace First movement, students at OAK are becoming the next generation of peacemakers who can create positive change around them. Students are taught to work effectively with others to resolve conflicts, solve community problems, communicate ideas effectively, and form positive social relationships. As students progress through the curriculum at each developmental level, from Kindergarten through 8th grade, they develop the courage and compassion they need to see themselves as leaders and to act with empathy toward others.

What do we believe and what are we all about? We are compelled by state law to teach the FSA (Florida Standard Assessments) which are the controversial Core Curriculum Standards you have read about with just a small number of adjustments. However, we teach beyond the standards and we firmly believe in setting expectations for our learners based upon a powerful work ethic. There is a demand for rigor and a process/product based approach. This is an organization of conservative values and powerful support for our military with the knowledge that not all students go to or need to go to college. Many need to move toward careers that better suit their lifeâs goals. However, our college preparatory program is dynamic with Advanced Placement and Dual Enrollment courses along with a middle school Pre-AP program. We also offer the SAIL (Studies in Advanced and Innovative Learning) Program in our high school. North Bay Haven and Bay Haven schools are consistently (for 13 years) ranked in the top 10% of all traditional and charter public schools in the State of Florida. We have the highest FCAT and EOC (End of Course) exams scores in Bay County every year in practically every subject at every grade level. Please visit our Foundation site at to learn more about supporting our schools. Thank you. 								There will be no school on Thursday or Friday, September 1st and 2nd, 2016.

At MHCS we believe that in order to be successful we must provide a holistic educational experience, tending to the developing mind, body, and character of our young scholars. Only in this way will we be preparing leaders for the 21st century. Under the guidance of a skilled coaching staff, Mott Hall offers a wide variety of after school athletic clubs and teams for both boys and girls including soccer, flag football, basketball and more. These opportunities not only help our scholars stay healthy they also provide college bound skills. Through our core values we teach our scholars the character skills to overcome the obstacles they face to being successful in life. These core values are Responsibility, Integrity, Scholarship, and Excellence. Scholars are introduced to these attributes from the moment they walk through our door and our values are reinforced throughout their time at Mott Hall through our school culture, our RISE Incentive Program, and our school affirmation. Our behavior and discipline approach provides an age-appropriate response to scholar misbehavior. We set firm limits for acceptable behavior and help teach scholars to make the right choices for themselves. When they do not we provide additional opportunities for them to practice the skills they need in small group and one-on-one settings. To foster a learning community free of distraction Mott Hall upholds a strict uniform policy. The policy is strictly enforced, with scholars expected to be in full uniform whenever they are on school grounds. Amendments to the uniform are only allowed for medical or religious reasons. Wearing our uniform each day reflects all four of our schoolâs core values of responsibility, integrity, scholarship, and excellence. to access the uniform website Our after school program allows scholars to pursue an interest and build skills in activities they can pursue in high school and college. These activities include visual art, music, theater, dance, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), Basketball, Football, and Soccer. We are seeking scholars interested in rising to the challenge of gaining entry into a top high school and ultimately going to college. These are young people who are willing to develop the core values of responsibility, integrity, scholarship, and excellence and demonstrate these values by wearing their uniform proudly, completing their homework every night, seeking out help from teachers and other adults when they need it, and developing college bound skills and interests through our enrichment program. If you are ready to rise to this challenge Mott Hall is for you. Each year Mott Hall Charter School accepts 90 rising 6th graders eligible to enroll in New York City schools with admissions preference given to students residing in Community School District 9 where the school is located.

We were happy to welcome all of our families back for the 2016-2017 school year. It is going to be a good one! SAFETY is our number one concern at Marshall Lane. Please help us to keep your children safe at school by following these important guidelines: We appreciate your help in keeping our campus safe for everyone. Thank you! Have you noticed the beautiful new building adjacent to our upper parking lot? It is the new home of our Campbell Care before and after school program. It contains a fabulous kitchen area and three spacious rooms for our students who participate in this program. Campbell Care is a great place to be! Susan Saba has been the administrative assistant at Marshall Lane for the past five years. She is an outstanding employee who was dedicated to helping all of the families at our school. Last spring, Susanâs family moved to Hollister. While she was hopeful that she could still remain in her job here, that has proven to be too difficult. Susanâs last day at Marshall Lane will be Friday, September 2nd. Our entire community thanks Susan for her years of service to our school. We will miss her and wish her well in her future endeavors. Our health clerk, Michelle Roberts, will be our new administrative assistant. She has worked in the district for the past ten years and has been at Marshall Lane for five years. As a community member and former PTA co-president at our school, Michelle is uniquely qualified for her new role. Please join me in congratulating and supporting her. The clerk job is currently posted. We will be interviewing and hiring a new person in this position in the upcoming weeks. As part of the Campbell Union School Districtâs effort to âgo greenâ, solar panels have been installed on the roof of several of our buildings. This project will be completed over the next few weeks and will begin to generate power for our school. With the new Campbell Care building on site, we were able to convert the old preschool and Campbell Care building into a bigger facility for our youngest students. The interior of the building was completely renovated over the summer and is now housing two preschool classes. Children from 2 to 4 years old may attend. For more information or to sign up please call (408) 341-7127. Partial and full day programs are available. During the first few weeks of school, our staff reviews the expectations that we have for our students. Our behavioral code is called STARS behavior which stands for: Safety First Take Responsibility Act with Integrity Remember Kindness Show Respect Ask your students to tell you what it means to them.

Click for even more information on LIFE Charter Middle School. LIFE Charter School is located inside of North Shore Middle School. LIFE (Learning Through Experience; Innovating Through Collaboration; Fueling an Entrepreneurial Spirit; Excelling in Leadership while building within Community) is a 6th-8th grade experience which focuses on helping students to develop perseverance, professionalism, and creativity through entrepreneurial learning experiences. The middle school math program is challenging and focuses on studentsâ ability to problem solve with an emphasis on explaining their reasoning skills both verbally and in writing. To enrich our mathematics program we have an Arrowhead High School math teacher on staff. Students who successfully pass geometry at the middle school are eligible to earn Arrowhead High School credit for the class. Students at LIFE Charter are engaged in learning through inquiry-based methods. A readers-writers workshop model is utilized for literacy instruction. Genius hour is a âhands-onâ time during the charter studentâs day where students are encouraged to delve deeper into topics that are of particular interest or are a passion for them. Students utilize inquiry-based methods to engage both during Genius Hour and during their entrepreneurial personal finance class. 6 th â 8 th Grade: 6 th â 8 th Grade: The comprehensive program extends into the middle school and features a variety of electives to match student interests, including: art, theatre, choir, musical performances, orchestra, band and jazz band. NSMSâs new STEM lab includes robotics, 3D printing and construction design. Our math program is challenging and ensures that students will meet and exceed high school expectations. To enrich our math program we have an Arrowhead High School teacher on staff at NSMS, which helps bridge the middle school math program with the high school math program. Part of the comprehensive curriculum is our state of the art STEM lab with 3D printing. The comprehensive teachers are collaborative and highly qualified by being certified in the content areas they teach in math, science and language arts. In a digital world, Hartland/Lakeside understands that many students learn well through the vast technological resources offered by our District. All of our classrooms have access to computers and iPads and incorporate many aspects of learning through technological media. Yet, our digital classrooms extend learning to a global venue where students interact with people from around the world. In addition, they are able to explore places and cultures different from their own environment, and learn firsthand from experts and scientists through a virtual interactive experience. Yet, one of the hallmarks of our digital classrooms is that they have become a model site of student and teacher learning and experiences that are shared with other staff members. As an example, digital classrooms have incorporated the use of Apple TV, where students can push their work wirelessly onto a large TV screen and where teachers use mobile devices to share videos and other visual learning cues. Another benefit to the digital classroom is enhanced communication with parents using various technological forms that were not available a few years back. This allows parents to have insights and information into their childâs daily schoolwork and learning expectations. The digital classrooms strive to develop an interactive and meaningful partnership where parents play a daily role with the teacher in their childâs education. Hartland/Lakeside offers onecharter schooland three magnet schoolsacross the K-8 grades. The charter consists of a K-2 fine arts schooland the two magnet schools offera 3-5-community learning multi-grade school, and a 6-8 entrepreneurial school. At Hartland/Lakeside, we understand that children learn differently and that the learning environment can play a role in how their engagement and motivation is expressed. Our charter and magnet schools provide alternative learning opportunities, where students can connect their interests to curricular objectives and extend their learning using approaches that work better for them. Hartland-Lakeside is a community oriented school district with high quality programs and services. It is located in the Village of Hartland, Wisconsin, and serves the Village of Hartland and the Towns of Delafield, Merton, and Pewaukee. The Hartland Lakeside School Districtâs Mission is to provide a diverse and dynamic educational program that meets the unique learning styles of all students. The Hartland Lakeside School District PTO is excited to have joined forces with the PTOs from Hartland South and North Shore Middle School.

At KIPP Generations Collegiate we believe that education provides choice for a future.We envision a generation of college ready critical thinkers who take responsibility for their learning and who contribute actively by giving back and paying forward.Our scholars will enter a college or university setting with an understanding that where they are from is very much a part of who they were meant to become, and the realization of their educational ambitions can change the trajectory of their futures, their familyâs future, and the community from which they belong.We will generate graduates who will âbe the change [we] wish to see in the worldâ. Service Learning Citizenship is one of KGCâs core values.To honor this value, we require our students to complete at least 80 hours of service learning activities to graduate.Instead of simply volunteering, our scholars integrate community service activities with an academic study to enrich learning, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen our community.Furthermore, we have at least one week during each school year devoted to service learning activities.At KGC, we believe that âWe Lift as We Climbâ and that our studentâs successes are rooted in the successes of those who came before and after us.As a new generation of hope, KGC will seek to establish mentoring roles with its feeder middle schools, (North Houston) and (East End). KGC provides a rigorous college-preparatory education with an emphasis on reading, writing, and critical thinking.

The goal of a classical education is to instill two virtues of great importance to our republic: wisdom and eloquence. Through broad study of the liberal arts and sciences, students will learn to see what is timeless and universal in human nature and human institutions. Reading old books as well as new, students will engage in ""The Great Conversation"" with thinkers throughout history, and be challenged to move beyond immediate experience and contemporary concerns to gain an abiding appreciation of the true, the good, and the beautiful in life. These fruits of a classical education lead to the highest outcome--wisdom--the knowledge of the world, well-developed ideals of what should be, and the character to act accordingly. Democracy requires persuading others, which is why students must also acquire eloquence. It is not enough to have a view of the true, the good, and the beautiful--citizens must be able to convey their perspective to others and engage in civil discourse to maintain and advance the republic. Challenged to work with original sources and to defend a point of view using logic, students will develop their rhetorical skills at a young age and continue to hone them throughout their education. By studying and articulating ideas aboutgovernment from Plato to John Locke and beyond, our students learn the principles of American politics that enable statesmanship. A ""charter school"" is a public school that is given the freedom to implement a different approach to education than the regular public schools. Charter schools are not religious, and do not screen applicants in any way. There is no tuition. Parents who would like their children to attend submit an application. If there are more applications than there are slots available, a public lottery is held to randomly choose students. Currently, there are over 5,400 charter schools in America, serving over 1.7 million students. A School for the Republic What is a Charter School?"

Tickets can be purchased in the school office. We learn ways to learn, grow, and lead that contribute to the larger community and invite our best human qualities to shine. Rooted in our local community, we learn in an authentic Montessori environment, growing as conscientious and joyful learners, inspired to lead in the world community. Children are surrounded by beautiful materials and creative expression is woven into each area of the curriculum. Focus on the story of the universe, how life develops, and our history to help develop awe and appreciation. Vast lessons on the solar system, Earth, biomes, continents, cultures, climate, landscape, natural resources, food, and architecture. A rich language environment encouraging self-expression, discussion, and use of a variety of reference materialsbeyond standard textbooks. Hands-on materials help students explore mathematical process, fosteringa real understanding and ability to apply skills in everyday life. Nurturingexploration and courage as a gateway to competence, independence and a sense of accomplishment. Cultivating curiosity and imagination at our amazing universe through discussions, observations, analysis and experiments. Exploration of the environment through the senses while developing a deep sense of appreciation and experience. The Montessori curriculum revolves around a fundamental belief that each child has an instinctive and spontaneous desire to learn . A charter school is a public school operated by a group of parents, teachers and/or community members as a semi-autonomous school of choice authorized by a school district. Attending our second year now, and my kids are always smiling, thriving really. They have learned wonderful social skills. My daughter, once introverted, is now quite extroverted and reaching out to other kids. Academically they have increased their desire to learn and greatly enjoy the studios they participate in, which have been: dance, chess, rocket building, recorder, needle felting, clay molding and Spanish.My children have also learned how to assert themselves and speak in a respectful manner to resolve conflicts with others. It is a wonderful school! Mom to 2nd and 3rd Year Owls and a Kindergarten Dove My husband and I regularly say that moving our daughter to CRS was the best parenting decision we have ever made. The changes that we have seen in her since being in an environment that accepts her for where she is right now and celebrates theunique needs of all of her classmates has been really huge. Learning all of the important lessons for school, but also how these apply to everyday life, and fostering a sense of community and responsibility is an incredible gift. Mom to 3rd Year Hummingbird No other local option would have given Grace the same opportunities to make an impact in her school community. From the beginning of first grade, she felt a sense of ownership in her classroom and school. Children are respected and treated as capable human beings. They are given liberty within limits so that they can make a difference in their own learning, their peersâ learning, and out in the world! Mom to 5th Year Great Blue Heron Please donât hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your interest in our school. We hope to see you soon!

Students graduate each year with an Associateâs Degree from San Jacinto College three weeks before walking across the stage and receiving a high school diploma from CCISD. Early college high school is a bold approach based on the principle that academic rigor, combined with the opportunity to save time and money, is a powerful motivator for students to work hard and meet serious intellectual challenges. Early College High Schools are designed so that low-income youth, first-generation college goers, English language learners, students of color, and other young people who are traditionally underrepresented in higher education can simultaneously earn a high school diploma and an associate degree or up to two years of credit toward a bachelorâs degreeâtuition free. Themajority of the students at Clear Horizons meet one of the four target population criterion defined for Early College High Schools (ECHS) by the Texas Education Agency (TEA): 1) students are first generation college goers, 2) students are from minority groups traditionally underrepresented on college campuses, 3) students are economically disadvantaged, and/or 4) students meet one of the thirteen Texas at-risk indicators. Clear Horizons Early College High School is a CCISD open enrollment charter school serving approximately 400 students, 100 per grade level. As defined by TEA, an ECHS may only service about 100 students per grade level. Eighth-grade students in CCISD may apply each spring to participate in the lottery selection for 125 seats in the freshman class. All coursework is at the Pre-Advanced Placement and Advanced Placement levels. In addition to regular degree coursework, service learning projects are required annually and internships are required in the junior and senior years.

Our programs help every student understand and develop their unique character strengths the same way that they study every other subject. They learn how to apply these to their studies, and cultural pursuits in a safe and supporting environment. A Balanced Education Your childâs confidence and sense of belonging will increase.
