The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball Coach: Christine Laird\\nFlag Football Coach: Coach Stewart\\nSoccer Coaches: Miguel Matthie\\nBasketball Coach: Coach Stewart\\nLady Gators Cheerleading Coaches: JuaQuanda Ross\\nGator Girls Peewee Chearleading Coaches: Ashley Tokan\\nTrack and Field Coaches:\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '),\n",

This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all!

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '),\n",

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '),\n",

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '),\n",

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '),\n",

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Charter Schools have the autonomy and choice to set many of their own policies related to such things as curriculum delivery, parent involvement, discipline, and special programs; however charter schools, as public educational institutions, must maintain accountability academically, financially, and in all areas of legal and safety compliance.\\nQ: What is the difference between the many different charter schools that exist?\\nA: Each charter school is different.\\xa0 They are run by independent boards and each charter school corporation has its own philosophy, vision and focus that determine the type of experience you will have if your child attends that particular charter school.\\xa0 For example, some charter schools focus on dual-language programs or performing arts magnet-like focuses while others maintain single-gender classrooms.\\nQ:\\xa0 How do I know if Somerset Academy Village is the right school for my child?\\nA: \\xa0Somerset has a strong academic focus and believes that each child should learn at his or her own pace, so we try to individualize our program to meet each child’s level and learning needs regardless of age. Our educational philosophy is based on some of the principles listed below:\\nSomerset Academy believes that a school should be a place where students love to learn, teachers love to teach, and parents are a key part of the educational process.\\nWe believe that students work “up” to standards that are set for them and so we set high expectations for all of our students.\\nWe believe in a “teaching by doing” approach to instruction and incorporate “hands on” activities in all of our instruction.\\nWe believe that all students can and will learn.\\nWe believe that each learner is unique; therefore we structure our academic program to meet the needs of each individual learner. We also allow learners to work at their own pace and engage in activities that meet different learning styles and levels simultaneously.\\nWe implement a program that will not only focus on a well-rounded educational program, but one that also has strong emphasis in college preparatory curriculum.\\nWe also involve our students in a number of community projects that teach them to connect learning to the “real world” both locally and globally.\\nWe believe learning should be fun.\\nWe encourage you to schedule some time to speak to our staff and get to know the Somerset team.\\xa0 We are always happy to answer any specific questions you may have.\\nQ: Do I have to pay to attend a charter school?\\nA: No.\\xa0 Since charter schools are publicly funded, K-12 students attend tuition FREE.\\nQ: What grades does Somerset Academy Village have?\\nA: We have K-8th grade at our campus.\\nQ: Can you give me some general background information about Somerset Academy?\\nA: Somerset was one of the first charter schools to open in south Florida in 1997.\\xa0 It was opened by parents and community members who wanted a school that maintained a strong neighborhood-school feel by (1) maintaining an open-door policy and high level of parent involvement, (2) by personalizing the academic program for each student, and (3) by delivering the curriculum in creative, hands-on and innovative ways.\\xa0 Today, Somerset Academy has numerous PK – 12th grade campuses in south, central and northern Florida.\\xa0 Visit \\nwww.somersetacademyschools.com\\n for more information about our schools.\\nQ: Are Somerset Academy Village teachers certified?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Our teachers and administrators are certified and highly qualified in their subject areas and meet the Florida state requirements for certification the same as any traditional public school educator.\\nQ: Does Somerset Academy require uniforms?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Both staff and students are required to wear uniforms.\\xa0 Uniforms at Somerset Academy Village will consist of polo shirts for elementary and middle school (royal blue, orange, or white) with navy blue, black or khaki bottoms.\\xa0 Middle school students also have the option of the button down Oxford collared short or long sleeve shirt (white only).

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

new laws in the 2014 Session to protect the safety and welfare of children after a series of articles in the Miami Herald found that the deaths of 479 children were the result of abuse and/or neglect.\\nAll Somerset Academy Village employees and agents of Academica are required by \\nlaw\\n to report any suspected case of child abuse, abandonment or neglect, as well as alleged misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student.\\nIt is the responsibility of every staff member to report all cases of suspected abuse

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

In order to do that, the school must have a strong, structured, and spiraling curriculum that meets the needs of students at different academic levels and with different learning styles. Somerset Academy has this type of program and includes both traditional and alternative approaches for instructing our students of all levels. Our curriculum is the common core and all of the courses and curriculum materials used are in alignment with those standards.\\nAll of these curricular programs are aligned to meet the goals of No Child Left Behind, to meet the requirements of the Broward County Pupil Progression Plan (Policy 6000.1), and to meet the grade level proficiency expectations of Florida’s Sunshine State Standards. By incorporating multiple learning systems at Somerset, we believe that we can create the best possible program for each individual learner while also making learning an exciting and enjoyable experience.\\nQ: Do you incorporate technology into your academic program?\\nA:\\xa0 Somerset also offers a state-of-the-art technology to enhance each child’s learning experience.\\xa0 The school is equipped with such things as stationary and mobile computer labs, Promethean Boards in each room, Document Imaging Cameras, and numerous classroom net books (laptops).\\xa0 In addition, many computer-based software programs are used; some of these include Accelerated Reader, Carnegie Cognitive Tutor, and Successmaker..\\nQ: Do you have a gifted program?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of gifted students in different ways depending on the population of gifted students and a student’s EP.\\nQ: My child has an IEP.\\xa0 Do you offer ESE services?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of ESE students in different ways depending on the student’s IEP.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESE Specialist to better understand our ESE program.\\nQ: My child doesn’t speak English well.\\xa0 Do you offer help for this?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 All Somerset schools have various classes and assistance programs to meet the needs of students who are Limited English Proficient to help them succeed in language development and in our academic program.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESOL coordinator for additional information.\\nQ: Do you offer special area classes and electives?\\nA: Yes, we will offer a variety of special area classes such as Physical Education, Art, Music, Library/Research, Foreign Language and Computers depending on our student interest and enrollment.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Academica was the first company in the state to seek SACS accreditation for the schools it serves, and all of the schools it serves are either fully accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation.\\nFor more information please visit \\nwww.academica.org\\n or call 305.669.2906\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=1349', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFAQ\\nSomerset Academy Village’s \\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BASICS\\nQ: What is a Charter School?\\nA: A Charter School is a public school of choice that is state-funded but privately operated. Charter Schools have the autonomy and choice to set many of their own policies related to such things as curriculum delivery, parent involvement, discipline, and special programs; however charter schools, as public educational institutions, must maintain accountability academically, financially, and in all areas of legal and safety compliance.\\nQ: What is the difference between the many different charter schools that exist?\\nA: Each charter school is different.\\xa0 They are run by independent boards and each charter school corporation has its own philosophy, vision and focus that determine the type of experience you will have if your child attends that particular charter school.\\xa0 For example, some charter schools focus on dual-language programs or performing arts magnet-like focuses while others maintain single-gender classrooms.\\nQ:\\xa0 How do I know if Somerset Academy Village is the right school for my child?\\nA: \\xa0Somerset has a strong academic focus and believes that each child should learn at his or her own pace, so we try to individualize our program to meet each child’s level and learning needs regardless of age. Our educational philosophy is based on some of the principles listed below:\\nSomerset Academy believes that a school should be a place where students love to learn, teachers love to teach, and parents are a key part of the educational process.\\nWe believe that students work “up” to standards that are set for them and so we set high expectations for all of our students.\\nWe believe in a “teaching by doing” approach to instruction and incorporate “hands on” activities in all of our instruction.\\nWe believe that all students can and will learn.\\nWe believe that each learner is unique; therefore we structure our academic program to meet the needs of each individual learner. We also allow learners to work at their own pace and engage in activities that meet different learning styles and levels simultaneously.\\nWe implement a program that will not only focus on a well-rounded educational program, but one that also has strong emphasis in college preparatory curriculum.\\nWe also involve our students in a number of community projects that teach them to connect learning to the “real world” both locally and globally.\\nWe believe learning should be fun.\\nWe encourage you to schedule some time to speak to our staff and get to know the Somerset team.\\xa0 We are always happy to answer any specific questions you may have.\\nQ: Do I have to pay to attend a charter school?\\nA: No.\\xa0 Since charter schools are publicly funded, K-12 students attend tuition FREE.\\nQ: What grades does Somerset Academy Village have?\\nA: We have K-8th grade at our campus.\\nQ: Can you give me some general background information about Somerset Academy?\\nA: Somerset was one of the first charter schools to open in south Florida in 1997.\\xa0 It was opened by parents and community members who wanted a school that maintained a strong neighborhood-school feel by (1) maintaining an open-door policy and high level of parent involvement, (2) by personalizing the academic program for each student, and (3) by delivering the curriculum in creative, hands-on and innovative ways.\\xa0 Today, Somerset Academy has numerous PK – 12th grade campuses in south, central and northern Florida.\\xa0 Visit \\nwww.somersetacademyschools.com\\n for more information about our schools.\\nQ: Are Somerset Academy Village teachers certified?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Our teachers and administrators are certified and highly qualified in their subject areas and meet the Florida state requirements for certification the same as any traditional public school educator.\\nQ: Does Somerset Academy require uniforms?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Both staff and students are required to wear uniforms.\\xa0 Uniforms at Somerset Academy Village will consist of polo shirts for elementary and middle school (royal blue, orange, or white) with navy blue, black or khaki bottoms.\\xa0 Middle school students also have the option of the button down Oxford collared short or long sleeve shirt (white only).

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

new laws in the 2014 Session to protect the safety and welfare of children after a series of articles in the Miami Herald found that the deaths of 479 children were the result of abuse and/or neglect.\\nAll Somerset Academy Village employees and agents of Academica are required by \\nlaw\\n to report any suspected case of child abuse, abandonment or neglect, as well as alleged misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student.\\nIt is the responsibility of every staff member to report all cases of suspected abuse

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

In order to do that, the school must have a strong, structured, and spiraling curriculum that meets the needs of students at different academic levels and with different learning styles. Somerset Academy has this type of program and includes both traditional and alternative approaches for instructing our students of all levels. Our curriculum is the common core and all of the courses and curriculum materials used are in alignment with those standards.\\nAll of these curricular programs are aligned to meet the goals of No Child Left Behind, to meet the requirements of the Broward County Pupil Progression Plan (Policy 6000.1), and to meet the grade level proficiency expectations of Florida’s Sunshine State Standards. By incorporating multiple learning systems at Somerset, we believe that we can create the best possible program for each individual learner while also making learning an exciting and enjoyable experience.\\nQ: Do you incorporate technology into your academic program?\\nA:\\xa0 Somerset also offers a state-of-the-art technology to enhance each child’s learning experience.\\xa0 The school is equipped with such things as stationary and mobile computer labs, Promethean Boards in each room, Document Imaging Cameras, and numerous classroom net books (laptops).\\xa0 In addition, many computer-based software programs are used; some of these include Accelerated Reader, Carnegie Cognitive Tutor, and Successmaker..\\nQ: Do you have a gifted program?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of gifted students in different ways depending on the population of gifted students and a student’s EP.\\nQ: My child has an IEP.\\xa0 Do you offer ESE services?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of ESE students in different ways depending on the student’s IEP.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESE Specialist to better understand our ESE program.\\nQ: My child doesn’t speak English well.\\xa0 Do you offer help for this?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 All Somerset schools have various classes and assistance programs to meet the needs of students who are Limited English Proficient to help them succeed in language development and in our academic program.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESOL coordinator for additional information.\\nQ: Do you offer special area classes and electives?\\nA: Yes, we will offer a variety of special area classes such as Physical Education, Art, Music, Library/Research, Foreign Language and Computers depending on our student interest and enrollment.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Academica was the first company in the state to seek SACS accreditation for the schools it serves, and all of the schools it serves are either fully accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation.\\nFor more information please visit \\nwww.academica.org\\n or call 305.669.2906\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=1349', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFAQ\\nSomerset Academy Village’s \\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BASICS\\nQ: What is a Charter School?\\nA: A Charter School is a public school of choice that is state-funded but privately operated. Charter Schools have the autonomy and choice to set many of their own policies related to such things as curriculum delivery, parent involvement, discipline, and special programs; however charter schools, as public educational institutions, must maintain accountability academically, financially, and in all areas of legal and safety compliance.\\nQ: What is the difference between the many different charter schools that exist?\\nA: Each charter school is different.\\xa0 They are run by independent boards and each charter school corporation has its own philosophy, vision and focus that determine the type of experience you will have if your child attends that particular charter school.\\xa0 For example, some charter schools focus on dual-language programs or performing arts magnet-like focuses while others maintain single-gender classrooms.\\nQ:\\xa0 How do I know if Somerset Academy Village is the right school for my child?\\nA: \\xa0Somerset has a strong academic focus and believes that each child should learn at his or her own pace, so we try to individualize our program to meet each child’s level and learning needs regardless of age. Our educational philosophy is based on some of the principles listed below:\\nSomerset Academy believes that a school should be a place where students love to learn, teachers love to teach, and parents are a key part of the educational process.\\nWe believe that students work “up” to standards that are set for them and so we set high expectations for all of our students.\\nWe believe in a “teaching by doing” approach to instruction and incorporate “hands on” activities in all of our instruction.\\nWe believe that all students can and will learn.\\nWe believe that each learner is unique; therefore we structure our academic program to meet the needs of each individual learner. We also allow learners to work at their own pace and engage in activities that meet different learning styles and levels simultaneously.\\nWe implement a program that will not only focus on a well-rounded educational program, but one that also has strong emphasis in college preparatory curriculum.\\nWe also involve our students in a number of community projects that teach them to connect learning to the “real world” both locally and globally.\\nWe believe learning should be fun.\\nWe encourage you to schedule some time to speak to our staff and get to know the Somerset team.\\xa0 We are always happy to answer any specific questions you may have.\\nQ: Do I have to pay to attend a charter school?\\nA: No.\\xa0 Since charter schools are publicly funded, K-12 students attend tuition FREE.\\nQ: What grades does Somerset Academy Village have?\\nA: We have K-8th grade at our campus.\\nQ: Can you give me some general background information about Somerset Academy?\\nA: Somerset was one of the first charter schools to open in south Florida in 1997.\\xa0 It was opened by parents and community members who wanted a school that maintained a strong neighborhood-school feel by (1) maintaining an open-door policy and high level of parent involvement, (2) by personalizing the academic program for each student, and (3) by delivering the curriculum in creative, hands-on and innovative ways.\\xa0 Today, Somerset Academy has numerous PK – 12th grade campuses in south, central and northern Florida.\\xa0 Visit \\nwww.somersetacademyschools.com\\n for more information about our schools.\\nQ: Are Somerset Academy Village teachers certified?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Our teachers and administrators are certified and highly qualified in their subject areas and meet the Florida state requirements for certification the same as any traditional public school educator.\\nQ: Does Somerset Academy require uniforms?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Both staff and students are required to wear uniforms.\\xa0 Uniforms at Somerset Academy Village will consist of polo shirts for elementary and middle school (royal blue, orange, or white) with navy blue, black or khaki bottoms.\\xa0 Middle school students also have the option of the button down Oxford collared short or long sleeve shirt (white only).

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

new laws in the 2014 Session to protect the safety and welfare of children after a series of articles in the Miami Herald found that the deaths of 479 children were the result of abuse and/or neglect.\\nAll Somerset Academy Village employees and agents of Academica are required by \\nlaw\\n to report any suspected case of child abuse, abandonment or neglect, as well as alleged misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student.\\nIt is the responsibility of every staff member to report all cases of suspected abuse

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

In order to do that, the school must have a strong, structured, and spiraling curriculum that meets the needs of students at different academic levels and with different learning styles. Somerset Academy has this type of program and includes both traditional and alternative approaches for instructing our students of all levels. Our curriculum is the common core and all of the courses and curriculum materials used are in alignment with those standards.\\nAll of these curricular programs are aligned to meet the goals of No Child Left Behind, to meet the requirements of the Broward County Pupil Progression Plan (Policy 6000.1), and to meet the grade level proficiency expectations of Florida’s Sunshine State Standards. By incorporating multiple learning systems at Somerset, we believe that we can create the best possible program for each individual learner while also making learning an exciting and enjoyable experience.\\nQ: Do you incorporate technology into your academic program?\\nA:\\xa0 Somerset also offers a state-of-the-art technology to enhance each child’s learning experience.\\xa0 The school is equipped with such things as stationary and mobile computer labs, Promethean Boards in each room, Document Imaging Cameras, and numerous classroom net books (laptops).\\xa0 In addition, many computer-based software programs are used; some of these include Accelerated Reader, Carnegie Cognitive Tutor, and Successmaker..\\nQ: Do you have a gifted program?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of gifted students in different ways depending on the population of gifted students and a student’s EP.\\nQ: My child has an IEP.\\xa0 Do you offer ESE services?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of ESE students in different ways depending on the student’s IEP.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESE Specialist to better understand our ESE program.\\nQ: My child doesn’t speak English well.\\xa0 Do you offer help for this?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 All Somerset schools have various classes and assistance programs to meet the needs of students who are Limited English Proficient to help them succeed in language development and in our academic program.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESOL coordinator for additional information.\\nQ: Do you offer special area classes and electives?\\nA: Yes, we will offer a variety of special area classes such as Physical Education, Art, Music, Library/Research, Foreign Language and Computers depending on our student interest and enrollment.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Academica was the first company in the state to seek SACS accreditation for the schools it serves, and all of the schools it serves are either fully accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation.\\nFor more information please visit \\nwww.academica.org\\n or call 305.669.2906\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=1349', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFAQ\\nSomerset Academy Village’s \\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BASICS\\nQ: What is a Charter School?\\nA: A Charter School is a public school of choice that is state-funded but privately operated. Charter Schools have the autonomy and choice to set many of their own policies related to such things as curriculum delivery, parent involvement, discipline, and special programs; however charter schools, as public educational institutions, must maintain accountability academically, financially, and in all areas of legal and safety compliance.\\nQ: What is the difference between the many different charter schools that exist?\\nA: Each charter school is different.\\xa0 They are run by independent boards and each charter school corporation has its own philosophy, vision and focus that determine the type of experience you will have if your child attends that particular charter school.\\xa0 For example, some charter schools focus on dual-language programs or performing arts magnet-like focuses while others maintain single-gender classrooms.\\nQ:\\xa0 How do I know if Somerset Academy Village is the right school for my child?\\nA: \\xa0Somerset has a strong academic focus and believes that each child should learn at his or her own pace, so we try to individualize our program to meet each child’s level and learning needs regardless of age. Our educational philosophy is based on some of the principles listed below:\\nSomerset Academy believes that a school should be a place where students love to learn, teachers love to teach, and parents are a key part of the educational process.\\nWe believe that students work “up” to standards that are set for them and so we set high expectations for all of our students.\\nWe believe in a “teaching by doing” approach to instruction and incorporate “hands on” activities in all of our instruction.\\nWe believe that all students can and will learn.\\nWe believe that each learner is unique; therefore we structure our academic program to meet the needs of each individual learner. We also allow learners to work at their own pace and engage in activities that meet different learning styles and levels simultaneously.\\nWe implement a program that will not only focus on a well-rounded educational program, but one that also has strong emphasis in college preparatory curriculum.\\nWe also involve our students in a number of community projects that teach them to connect learning to the “real world” both locally and globally.\\nWe believe learning should be fun.\\nWe encourage you to schedule some time to speak to our staff and get to know the Somerset team.\\xa0 We are always happy to answer any specific questions you may have.\\nQ: Do I have to pay to attend a charter school?\\nA: No.\\xa0 Since charter schools are publicly funded, K-12 students attend tuition FREE.\\nQ: What grades does Somerset Academy Village have?\\nA: We have K-8th grade at our campus.\\nQ: Can you give me some general background information about Somerset Academy?\\nA: Somerset was one of the first charter schools to open in south Florida in 1997.\\xa0 It was opened by parents and community members who wanted a school that maintained a strong neighborhood-school feel by (1) maintaining an open-door policy and high level of parent involvement, (2) by personalizing the academic program for each student, and (3) by delivering the curriculum in creative, hands-on and innovative ways.\\xa0 Today, Somerset Academy has numerous PK – 12th grade campuses in south, central and northern Florida.\\xa0 Visit \\nwww.somersetacademyschools.com\\n for more information about our schools.\\nQ: Are Somerset Academy Village teachers certified?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Our teachers and administrators are certified and highly qualified in their subject areas and meet the Florida state requirements for certification the same as any traditional public school educator.\\nQ: Does Somerset Academy require uniforms?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Both staff and students are required to wear uniforms.\\xa0 Uniforms at Somerset Academy Village will consist of polo shirts for elementary and middle school (royal blue, orange, or white) with navy blue, black or khaki bottoms.\\xa0 Middle school students also have the option of the button down Oxford collared short or long sleeve shirt (white only).

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

new laws in the 2014 Session to protect the safety and welfare of children after a series of articles in the Miami Herald found that the deaths of 479 children were the result of abuse and/or neglect.\\nAll Somerset Academy Village employees and agents of Academica are required by \\nlaw\\n to report any suspected case of child abuse, abandonment or neglect, as well as alleged misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student.\\nIt is the responsibility of every staff member to report all cases of suspected abuse

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

In order to do that, the school must have a strong, structured, and spiraling curriculum that meets the needs of students at different academic levels and with different learning styles. Somerset Academy has this type of program and includes both traditional and alternative approaches for instructing our students of all levels. Our curriculum is the common core and all of the courses and curriculum materials used are in alignment with those standards.\\nAll of these curricular programs are aligned to meet the goals of No Child Left Behind, to meet the requirements of the Broward County Pupil Progression Plan (Policy 6000.1), and to meet the grade level proficiency expectations of Florida’s Sunshine State Standards. By incorporating multiple learning systems at Somerset, we believe that we can create the best possible program for each individual learner while also making learning an exciting and enjoyable experience.\\nQ: Do you incorporate technology into your academic program?\\nA:\\xa0 Somerset also offers a state-of-the-art technology to enhance each child’s learning experience.\\xa0 The school is equipped with such things as stationary and mobile computer labs, Promethean Boards in each room, Document Imaging Cameras, and numerous classroom net books (laptops).\\xa0 In addition, many computer-based software programs are used; some of these include Accelerated Reader, Carnegie Cognitive Tutor, and Successmaker..\\nQ: Do you have a gifted program?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of gifted students in different ways depending on the population of gifted students and a student’s EP.\\nQ: My child has an IEP.\\xa0 Do you offer ESE services?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of ESE students in different ways depending on the student’s IEP.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESE Specialist to better understand our ESE program.\\nQ: My child doesn’t speak English well.\\xa0 Do you offer help for this?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 All Somerset schools have various classes and assistance programs to meet the needs of students who are Limited English Proficient to help them succeed in language development and in our academic program.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESOL coordinator for additional information.\\nQ: Do you offer special area classes and electives?\\nA: Yes, we will offer a variety of special area classes such as Physical Education, Art, Music, Library/Research, Foreign Language and Computers depending on our student interest and enrollment.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Academica was the first company in the state to seek SACS accreditation for the schools it serves, and all of the schools it serves are either fully accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation.\\nFor more information please visit \\nwww.academica.org\\n or call 305.669.2906\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=1349', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFAQ\\nSomerset Academy Village’s \\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BASICS\\nQ: What is a Charter School?\\nA: A Charter School is a public school of choice that is state-funded but privately operated. Charter Schools have the autonomy and choice to set many of their own policies related to such things as curriculum delivery, parent involvement, discipline, and special programs; however charter schools, as public educational institutions, must maintain accountability academically, financially, and in all areas of legal and safety compliance.\\nQ: What is the difference between the many different charter schools that exist?\\nA: Each charter school is different.\\xa0 They are run by independent boards and each charter school corporation has its own philosophy, vision and focus that determine the type of experience you will have if your child attends that particular charter school.\\xa0 For example, some charter schools focus on dual-language programs or performing arts magnet-like focuses while others maintain single-gender classrooms.\\nQ:\\xa0 How do I know if Somerset Academy Village is the right school for my child?\\nA: \\xa0Somerset has a strong academic focus and believes that each child should learn at his or her own pace, so we try to individualize our program to meet each child’s level and learning needs regardless of age. Our educational philosophy is based on some of the principles listed below:\\nSomerset Academy believes that a school should be a place where students love to learn, teachers love to teach, and parents are a key part of the educational process.\\nWe believe that students work “up” to standards that are set for them and so we set high expectations for all of our students.\\nWe believe in a “teaching by doing” approach to instruction and incorporate “hands on” activities in all of our instruction.\\nWe believe that all students can and will learn.\\nWe believe that each learner is unique; therefore we structure our academic program to meet the needs of each individual learner. We also allow learners to work at their own pace and engage in activities that meet different learning styles and levels simultaneously.\\nWe implement a program that will not only focus on a well-rounded educational program, but one that also has strong emphasis in college preparatory curriculum.\\nWe also involve our students in a number of community projects that teach them to connect learning to the “real world” both locally and globally.\\nWe believe learning should be fun.\\nWe encourage you to schedule some time to speak to our staff and get to know the Somerset team.\\xa0 We are always happy to answer any specific questions you may have.\\nQ: Do I have to pay to attend a charter school?\\nA: No.\\xa0 Since charter schools are publicly funded, K-12 students attend tuition FREE.\\nQ: What grades does Somerset Academy Village have?\\nA: We have K-8th grade at our campus.\\nQ: Can you give me some general background information about Somerset Academy?\\nA: Somerset was one of the first charter schools to open in south Florida in 1997.\\xa0 It was opened by parents and community members who wanted a school that maintained a strong neighborhood-school feel by (1) maintaining an open-door policy and high level of parent involvement, (2) by personalizing the academic program for each student, and (3) by delivering the curriculum in creative, hands-on and innovative ways.\\xa0 Today, Somerset Academy has numerous PK – 12th grade campuses in south, central and northern Florida.\\xa0 Visit \\nwww.somersetacademyschools.com\\n for more information about our schools.\\nQ: Are Somerset Academy Village teachers certified?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Our teachers and administrators are certified and highly qualified in their subject areas and meet the Florida state requirements for certification the same as any traditional public school educator.\\nQ: Does Somerset Academy require uniforms?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Both staff and students are required to wear uniforms.\\xa0 Uniforms at Somerset Academy Village will consist of polo shirts for elementary and middle school (royal blue, orange, or white) with navy blue, black or khaki bottoms.\\xa0 Middle school students also have the option of the button down Oxford collared short or long sleeve shirt (white only).

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.

The guiding principle behind our participation in athletics is our belief in its educational value for our students.\\xa0 Athletics promotes character traits of high value to personal development and success in later life. These include the drive to take one’s talents to the highest level of performance; embracing the discipline needed to reach high standards; learning to work with others as a team in pursuit of a common goal; and adherence to codes of fairness and respect.\\xa0 Athletics also plays an important role in creating a sense of community in the school.\\nSomerset Village’s mission defines expectations both on the field and off.\\xa0 In the name of excellence, we aim for a level of athletic performance that will frequently produce winning seasons and the realistic opportunity to compete for championships.\\xa0 Our mission also requires that our athletes be students first, that they be allowed to participate with careful attention to their academic record and motivation, as well as their behavior both on the field and in the classroom.\\nAthletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills. Somerset Village values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on the field and off, adherence to the spirit of rules, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship – respect for one’s opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace. In teaching these lessons to its students, Somerset Village instills habits which will lead students to better and healthier lives. While winning is not an end in itself, we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed throughout their lives.\\nAthletic Director: JuaQuanda Ross\\nVolleyball

is to ensure that all students are provided with the necessary tools to rise above and beyond.\\xa0 With the continued dedication of teachers, efforts of students, cooperation of parents, and the support of the community, everyone will succeed! This is why our motto for the year has been “Be Phenomenal!” because that is what we do on a daily basis.\\nIn the life of the school, each year is special. This year is certainly no exception. We are so very proud to be a part of this fabulous learning community where faculty, staff, parents, and community members work together to provide our students with authentic, challenging, and collaborative educational experiences.\\xa0 We aspire to ensure all students strive to achieve their personal best, both academically and socially.\\nSometimes a school is seen just as a place where students learn and teacher teach. However, a true education is much more. By working together and striving for excellence, we not only want our students to achieve their full potential academically, but we also want to truly educate our students in a way that will make them well-rounded human beings equipped for their future.\\nWe have been humbled by the skills of the staff and enthusiasm of the youth. For this, we thank you all! We are truly excited for Somerset Village’s continued growth and success.\\nMr. Marucci and Ms. Boiteux\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

new laws in the 2014 Session to protect the safety and welfare of children after a series of articles in the Miami Herald found that the deaths of 479 children were the result of abuse and/or neglect.\\nAll Somerset Academy Village employees and agents of Academica are required by \\nlaw\\n to report any suspected case of child abuse, abandonment or neglect, as well as alleged misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student.\\nIt is the responsibility of every staff member to report all cases of suspected abuse

Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath

They are nonsectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools.\\nThe “charters” establishing such schools are performance contracts detailing the schools’ mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school’s contract.\\nCharter schools are accountable to their sponsor, usually a state or local school board, to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?page_id=2128', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducation Service Provider\\nSomerset Academy Village is serviced by Academica.\\nAcademica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations.

In order to do that, the school must have a strong, structured, and spiraling curriculum that meets the needs of students at different academic levels and with different learning styles. Somerset Academy has this type of program and includes both traditional and alternative approaches for instructing our students of all levels. Our curriculum is the common core and all of the courses and curriculum materials used are in alignment with those standards.\\nAll of these curricular programs are aligned to meet the goals of No Child Left Behind, to meet the requirements of the Broward County Pupil Progression Plan (Policy 6000.1), and to meet the grade level proficiency expectations of Florida’s Sunshine State Standards. By incorporating multiple learning systems at Somerset, we believe that we can create the best possible program for each individual learner while also making learning an exciting and enjoyable experience.\\nQ: Do you incorporate technology into your academic program?\\nA:\\xa0 Somerset also offers a state-of-the-art technology to enhance each child’s learning experience.\\xa0 The school is equipped with such things as stationary and mobile computer labs, Promethean Boards in each room, Document Imaging Cameras, and numerous classroom net books (laptops).\\xa0 In addition, many computer-based software programs are used; some of these include Accelerated Reader, Carnegie Cognitive Tutor, and Successmaker..\\nQ: Do you have a gifted program?\\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of gifted students in different ways depending on the population of gifted students and a student’s EP.\\nQ: My child has an IEP.\\xa0 Do you offer ESE services?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 Each school meets the needs of ESE students in different ways depending on the student’s IEP.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESE Specialist to better understand our ESE program.\\nQ: My child doesn’t speak English well.\\xa0 Do you offer help for this?\\xa0 \\nA: Yes.\\xa0 All Somerset schools have various classes and assistance programs to meet the needs of students who are Limited English Proficient to help them succeed in language development and in our academic program.\\xa0 Please schedule a meeting with our ESOL coordinator for additional information.\\nQ: Do you offer special area classes and electives?\\nA: Yes, we will offer a variety of special area classes such as Physical Education, Art, Music, Library/Research, Foreign Language and Computers depending on our student interest and enrollment.

Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home

welcome you and your child to Somerset Academy Wilton Manors. Your child is entering a specially prepared environment that is warm, secure, and challenging; a place in which to grow socially, physically, and creatively. This will be a great year at Somerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors. Our staff is outstanding and as a “family” unit parents and teachers will work together to provide a wonderful education for our terrific students.\\nWe know that children learn in different ways and at different rates, so we provide experiences that take these differences into consideration. We encourage a love of learning and of self. Young children question the obvious and see mystery in the commonplace. We know that remarks of children have meaning and reveal modes of reasoning and judgment based upon their developmental abilities. Our classrooms are places for thinking activities and the emphasis is on the child as “thinker-in-action” where he or she is encouraged to be an active participant in the learning process. We guide the students to seek out, select and deal with objects and happenings in our exciting school environment.\\nPhilosophy of Somerset Academy Elementary Charter School\\nThe word philosophy is a very grown up word. It has to do with what we believe, and how those beliefs influence what we do and how we act. All of us at Somerset Wilton Manors work so well together because we share the same philosophy, the same beliefs, about what our school should be like.\\n• We believe that teaching and learning is very serious business, but it should be exciting and fun.\\n• We believe that along with reading, writing, and mathematics you should learn many other things, such as art, science, and social sciences.\\n• We feel that you should begin to learn about yourself as a person about how terrific and special you are, and can be.\\n• We believe you must learn to get along with people of all ages and all backgrounds; you must learn to respect others and to earn the respect of others.\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nCharter schools are non-profit, self-managed public schools (serving students in grades K- 12). Although they must be approved and monitored by the local school board, they are run independently – like private schools except that you do not have to pay tuition! Charter schools are funded by state and local monies and are open to any student.\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Village at Wilton Manors is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that stimulates creative thinking, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning.\\n6• We believe that children can learn better when they are grouped with children of different levels because there is more opportunity to progress at their own individual pace. Students in Somerset’s elementary grades learn in multi-level classrooms and a 4-year degreed certified teacher in each elementary class. Teachers are trained to teach children in small groups allowing more individualized instruction.\\n• We believe that each child comes with a unique learning style. Therefore, the academic design for each student at Somerset Academy is based on his/her own unique style.\\n• We believe that all children live up – or down – to the expectations set for them. Thus, the Somerset Academy will set high academic and behavioral expectations for all of its students.\\n• We believe that learning can, and should, be fun. Therefore, we will create an environment of joyful learning. Students will be exposed to an array of activities that they would not otherwise have in a traditional school setting. This is not to suggest that learning is entertainment. Sometimes it is hard work; but hard work can be fun if it is approached with a joyful attitude.\\n• We believe that students learn best when their parents are actively involved in the school community. Therefore, parents must agree to become actively involved in Somerset Academy, providing both transportation to and from school, lunch and completing 30 volunteer hours per family per school year. A parental involvement obligation is established to ensure, where possible, that a parent will actively participate in his/her student’s education. That will be the only “tuition” a parent pays, and we believe it is an important element to ensure parental “investment” in their student’s education.\\n• We believe that character development is an important element in the development of the student into a productive member of society. Somerset will encourage its students to become involved in the community through community service programs and volunteerism. This is the student counterpart to the parental involvement obligation. Students will be encouraged to “invest” volunteer time in service to their school and/or community.\\n• We believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to succeed. Therefore, Somerset’s staff will mentor students thereby increasing self-esteem. Many students have experienced failure in the classroom, and as a result have poor self-images as learners. Because of prior experiences, they resist the educational process through inappropriate behavior. Therefore, we will build in mechanisms to ensure the improvement of the students’ self-images as learners; concurrently, we\\xa0will build in behavior management techniques to ensure improvement of behavior.\\n• We believe creative endeavors are an integral part of the growth and development of all students. Through our partnerships with local colleges and universities, we will be able to incorporate, as well as develop, avenues of creativity into the curriculum at all grade levels.\\n• We believe that high expectations engender success. Both students and teachers live either up or down to expectations set for them. This includes both academic and behavioral expectations. “Students do best – intellectually, personally, morally – when they are striving for excellence.” (Damon). Therefore, we will set high academic standards and behavioral expectations for students; we will set high academic/teaching standards and behavior expectations for teachers.\\n• We believe that students who understand how they learn do best in school (Wang, Haertel, & Wahlberg) Those students plan their learning, monitor it, and re-plan when necessary.\\n• We believe success breeds success. Therefore, students will be given opportunities to succeed. We believe that students have more opportunities to succeed when they can progress on a continuum. “…(I)n the best educational environment available, each student proceeds at speeds and depths of thinking that are appropriate and generate success for that student.” (Hunter)\\n• We believe that students and teachers are responsible for their actions. Therefore, we will hold students accountable for their actions (see section on behavior management); we will hold teachers accountable for their actions (see section on personnel policies and practices).\\n• We believe that students learn best in small schools. “Large schools neither nourish the spirit nor educate the mind.” (Meier). Somerset Academy is a small size for a public elementary school, and therefore, lends itself to individualized attention to students needs.\\nONLINE RESOURCES\\nAR\\nAR Book Finder\\nAR Home Connect\\nBasis\\nBSA\\nFSA\\ni-Ready\\niCivics\\nMath Facts\\nPinnacle-Online Gradebook\\nSight Words\\nSomerset Virtual\\nThinkCentral\\nTyping Web\\nVirtual Counselor\\nNews / Events\\nAttendance FAQ\\n3 Mar ’16\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJust Take 20!\\n26 Nov ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPolicy 6000.1-Promotion Criteria\\n5 Mar ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFSA Important links\\n11 Feb ’15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSearch for:\\n\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\n SOMERSET ACADEMY VILLAGE 2016  '), ('http://www.somersetwm.com/wordpress/?cat=1', 'False', '1', ' Phone: (954) 390-0971\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\namarucci@somersetwm.com\\nContact\\nNews\\nPartners\\nRegister\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nAccreditation\\nAcademic Performance\\nContact\\nPrincipal’s Message\\nParent Liaison\\nEducation Service Provider\\nFAQ\\nGovernance & Financials\\nBoard Members\\nBoard Minutes\\nBoard Meetings\\nBoard Speaker Form\\nBudgets and Financials\\nNews and Bulletin\\nSchool Mission\\nSomerset Academy Inc.\\nTitle 1\\nPartners\\nPublic Records Request\\nWhat are Charter Schools?\\nWho We Are\\nRegister\\nStudents / Parents\\nKey Information Bulletin\\nSAC/Parent Meetings\\nTutoring\\nUniform Policy\\nStudent Links\\nClubs\\nChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\\nStudent Code of Conduct\\nStudent Progression Plan\\nSupply Lists\\nSummer Reading Lists\\nVolunteer Opportunities\\nCalendars\\nActivities Calendar\\nBroward County Calendar 2017-2018\\nCurriculum\\nElementary Curriculum\\nMiddle School Curriculum Guide\\nLunch Menu\\nAthletics\\nAthletics Calendar\\nForms\\nStaff\\nClass Pages\\nEmployee Portal\\nStaff Directory\\nSelect Page\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAttendance FAQ\\nJust Take 20!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe FDOE has officially launched the Just Take 20 website at http://justtake20.org/ to encourage families to set aside 20 minutes a day for reading.
