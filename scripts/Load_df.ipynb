In Northwest Arkansas the discrepancy in funding is substantial. For the 2015-2016 school year, funding levels for our schools were as follows:\\\\nHaas Hall Academy Needs Your Support\\\\nHaas Hall Academy’s rich and diverse academic\\\\xa0offerings are largely made possible by the generous gifts received throughout the year.\\\\nDonations to fundraising events, the Annual Fund Campaign, matching gifts, the \\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\n, and special campaigns enable us to provide our scholars with the finest, accelerated college preparatory education in the state of Arkansas.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy receives the state minimum per child, but does not receive additional monies for facilities and ancillary programs that local millages provide for traditional public schools. Your support is essential to our continued success.\\\\n Contribute to Haas Hall Academy\\\\nMajor Gifts\\\\nPrivate support makes a significant difference in the daily lives of our scholars. For example, in the fall of 2015, Haas Hall Academy named our new Fayetteville campus— The Starr Scholar Center\\\\xa0—after Billie Jo Starr, a great champion of education who has done so much to enrich the quality of life in Northwest Arkansas and specifically, the city of Fayetteville.\\\\nMrs. Starr’s financial commitment to provide all new furnishings for this location is a gift that our scholars and faculty enjoy everyday. The Starr family’s generosity has allowed our faculty, staff, and scholars to feel like they are valued and deserve a well-appointed environment to match their exceptional level of performance in the classroom.\\\\n Contribute to Haas Hall Academy\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nAnnual giving by families and friends of Haas Hall Academy is a vital part of our development program. Unrestricted gifts provide a crucial bridge between state funds and the actual cost of running Haas Hall Academy.\\\\nGiving to the Annual Fund allows the school to respond to pressing needs and to provide the flexibility to meet the changing needs of our scholars and the School.\\\\nExamples of how Annual Fund gifts are used include updating technology, assisting faculty with classroom materials, and professional development. Funds are also used to support scholars who need assistance purchasing uniforms, school lunches, and AP testing fees.\\\\nOur financial strength is dependent on the participation of our entire school community. Your participation generates enthusiasm and encourages other to join you in supporting the School.\\\\nParents, alumni, faculty, grandparents, and friends of the school are encouraged to contribute to the Annual Fund.\\\\nThe 2016 Annual Fund goal is $200,000\\\\n Contribute Now\\\\nMatching Gifts\\\\n600+ companies nationwide match their employee’s contributions to secondary schools. \\\\nFIND OUT IF YOUR COMPANY MATCHES!\\\\nPlease take advantage of the company privilege by obtaining a Matching Gift application from your personnel office and sending it with your contribution to Haas Hall Academy. We will process the form immediately, and Haas Hall Academy will be the beneficiary of your generosity and that of your company.\\\\nNot sure if your company matches gifts? \\\\nCheck here!\\\\nShare this:\\\\nFacebook\\\\nTwitter\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nGoogle\\\\nEmail\\\\nPrint\\\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\n   |   \\\\nSchools\\\\n   |   \\\\nContact Us\\\\n   |   \\\\nNewsletter\\\\n   |   \\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n   |   \\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\\\nSend to Email Address\\\\nYour Name\\\\nYour Email Address\\\\nCancel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\'), (\\'https://www.haashall.org/password-reset/\\', \\'False\\', \\'2\\', \", \\\\nsite translator\\\\n, \\\\nautomatic translation\\\\n, \\\\nfree translation\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nHome\\\\nPassword Reset\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPassword Reset\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nLogin\\\\nUsername or email\\\\nPassword\\\\n Remember Me\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tAlready have an account?

The local corporate offices of over 1,200 Walmart vendors bring highly educated employees of companies like Coca-Cola, Dell, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Pfizer, PepsiCo, and Procter & Gamble to the area. \\\\xa0\\\\nThe 2012 US Census estimates the population of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers Metropolitan Area to be over 480,000, and the current growth rate ranges from 2percent to 4 percent per year.\\\\nThe School\\\\nHaas Hall Academy is a small, comprehensive institution promoting an accelerated college preparatory curriculum and serving scholars in grades 7 through 12. \\\\xa0Haas Hall Academy is the state’s only open-enrollment charter high school focusing on rigor and high academic standards.

Don’t get me wrong, my grades were pretty good, but they didn’t matter much to me. Sometimes I would write essays that, though pages and pages long, felt totally empty… a thousand words from my head that meant nothing to me. It was exhausting.\\\\nAfter making the switch, I was elated to discover a change in my attitude. I no longer dreaded the next school day. Instead, I was curious and interested to see what school may offer me each day. I threw myself into all kinds of activities and really found my niche. I finally felt like school mattered.\\\\nAt Haas Hall, there is always something to be done and something to look forward to. Switching schools meant a few days of anxiety and at least a week of mild apprehension. But, as my nerves subsided, I found that they were promptly replaced with joy.\\\\nMaddy, graduated 2014\\\\n“The atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper. Acheivement in academics is always encouraged and rewarded, not just by the school, but by the competitive nature of the student body.”\\\\nRead More\\\\nGanesh,\\\\xa0sophomore\\\\n“When I came to this school, it was the smallest school I had ever been to, and I thought to myself, ‘How can this be the best school in Arkansas?’\\\\xa0I came to Haas and I found out how hard I really have to work to get into a good college and be successful in life.”\\\\nRead More\\\\nAsa,\\\\xa0junior\\\\n“One thing that has always stuck out to me about Haas Hall is the willingness of the teachers to help each individual scholar, to create a healthy work environment, and to actually get to know their students personally.”\\\\nRead More\\\\nShare this:\\\\nFacebook\\\\nTwitter\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nGoogle\\\\nEmail\\\\nPrint\\\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\n   |   \\\\nSchools\\\\n   |   \\\\nContact Us\\\\n   |   \\\\nNewsletter\\\\n   |   \\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n   |   \\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\\\nSend to Email Address\\\\nYour Name\\\\nYour Email Address\\\\nCancel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\'), (\\'https://www.haashall.org/resources/weekly-lunch-club-schedule/\\', \\'False\\', \\'1\\', \", \\\\nsite translator\\\\n, \\\\nautomatic translation\\\\n, \\\\nfree translation\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nHome\\\\nResources\\\\nWeekly Lunch & Club Schedule\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tWeekly Lunch & Club Schedule\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nLogin\\\\nUsername or email\\\\nPassword\\\\n Remember Me\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tAlready have an account?

Haas Hall Academy’s academic prestige and intmate size recommended it as the ideal school to prepare me for college. This school has become much more to me, however, than simply a transitional place.\\\\nThe atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper. Acheivement in academics is always encouraged and rewarded, not just by the school, but by the competitive nature of the student body. Because of the small classes and block schedule, it is easy to become fully engaged within the classroom and intensely focused on each area of interest. My teachers truly care about my success, both during my time at Haas Hall and beyond, and several teachers have gone out of their way to ensure that I understand individual concepts.\\\\nMost importantly, however, is the feeling of responsibility shared by the scholars at this school. We are humbled by our role in contributing to the success of the #1 Public High School in Arkansas, and we strive to continue to make our teachers, school, and state proud.\\\\nElijah,\\\\xa0grade 9\\\\n“I am always getting pushed and encouraged by teachers, classmates, and my parents to strive to be my best.

academic excellence. Haas Hall Academy holds two prestigious academic events each year the day after Memorial Day, Convocation and Hall of Honors ceremonies. These two significant events are the culmination of years of hard work, persistence, and the respect of the dynamic partnership from all stakeholders which embodies the educational endeavor. There is an uncompromising level of satisfaction knowing our scholars took the challenging route and were extremely successful.\\\\nConvocation is a celebration of scholarship.\\\\nThis significant accomplishment embodies the complete scholar. Our graduates have earned the right to call themselves Haas Hall Academy alumni. Scholars, parents and faculty take great pride in the unparalled level of preparation our scholars receive at Haas Hall Academy for their higher educational pursuits.\\\\nThe Hall of Honors Induction Ceremony provides an opportunity for our academic community to recognize scholars of proven academic ability who desire intellectual challenge and the opportunity for creative interaction in a highly personalized teaching environment in a specific course. These scholars exhibit excellent conduct and a demonstrated ability to work well with and assist others. These scholars are accurate and prompt with homework, have spotless attendance records and are active participants in the classroom.\\\\nThese two ceremonies provide a public venue for all in our community to see the results of our uncompromising, accelerated college-preparatory academic programs which have given Haas Hall Academy national accolades. Haas Hall Academy is a multiple national award-winning model of how a charter school can strengthen communities, inspire innovation and be a catalyst for the renewal of expectations for public education. Haas Hall Academy is the #1 ranked public high school in the state of Arkansas for the fifth\\\\xa0consecutive year according to U.S. News and World Report and ranked #19 in the nation according to Newsweek.\\\\nShare this:\\\\nFacebook\\\\nTwitter\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nGoogle\\\\nEmail\\\\nPrint\\\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\n   |   \\\\nSchools\\\\n   |   \\\\nContact Us\\\\n   |   \\\\nNewsletter\\\\n   |   \\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n   |   \\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\\\nSend to Email Address\\\\nYour Name\\\\nYour Email Address\\\\nCancel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\'), (\\'https://www.haashall.org/resources/\\', \\'False\\', \\'1\\', \", \\\\nsite translator\\\\n, \\\\nautomatic translation\\\\n, \\\\nfree translation\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nHome\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tResources\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nLogin\\\\nUsername or email\\\\nPassword\\\\n Remember Me\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tAlready have an account?

In our resolve to ensure a safe, secure and disciplined learning environment, we believe that the establishment of a uniform dress code is a fundamental aspect of this effort. The dress code prepares our scholars for life as professionals, as it is a way of preparing them for the more formal world of work. Haas Hall Academy attracts scholars from 19 school districts, six private schools and a large home school base, therefore our uniforms are our community’s identity. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the potential benefits of a uniform dress code are: decreasing violence and theft — even life-threatening situations — among students over designer clothing or expensive sneakers; helping prevent gang members from wearing gang colors and insignia at school; instilling students with discipline; helping parents and students resist peer pressure; helping students concentrate on their school work; and helping school officials recognize intruders who come to the school.\\\\nView Uniform Style & Color Options\\\\nLand’s End: Haas Hall Academy’s Web Portal \\\\n–\\\\xa0Purchase your Scholar’s Uniforms Online\\\\nDownload the 2016 – 2017 Dress Code Policy\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nAHERA Inspection and Management Plan\\\\nSchool Board Policies\\\\nPersonnel Policies (Licensed/Classified)\\\\nMedia Policy\\\\nWe ask that all media requests (via telephone, fax, or e-mail) be directed to \\\\nCarin Schoppmeyer\\\\n, Director of School-Community Relations, who will promptly respond to your request either by e-mail at or by phone.

Thanks to a $1 million gift from the Walton Family Foundation, Haas Hall Academy is more than halfway to the goal of raising $1,850,000 to make the Ingenuity Center a reality.\\\\nSketch by Haas Hall Academy Scholar Piper Hart\\\\nAn additional $850,000 needs to be raised to complete the renovation and furnishing of the Ingenuity Center. Your gift will help to enhance the learning environment for our current scholars and ensure that more scholars in Northwest Arkansas will benefit from the free, accelerated, college-preparatory experience that Haas Hall Academy has offered for the past 12 years.\\\\nVisual Design Studio\\\\nWebsite design, coding, software development &\\\\xa0information technology classes will better prepare scholars for their college and and career experiences.\\\\nArt\\\\xa0Studio\\\\nHands-on drawing, painting, sculpture, & pottery classes will feature a kiln, drying racks and desktop easels to foster scholar creatively like never before.\\\\nArt\\\\xa0Gallery\\\\nFor the first time in Haas Hall history, a space will be dedicated to display original scholar artwork to share creative pieces with others outside of art classes.\\\\nPhysics Lab\\\\nA dedicated space for physics and physical science will engage eager scientific minds, enabling scholars to find answers, perform procedures, and collect and analyze laboratory evidence.\\\\nMusic Studio\\\\nIn a space dedicated to musical study, Haas Hall scholars will enhance their creative thinking and con dence, develop their performance skills, and master memorization and coordination.\\\\n3D Design\\\\xa0Studio\\\\nThe 3D Design Studio will feature 3D printers and CNC work stations for a variety of engineering-based projects to support Haas Hall’s innovative STEAM curriculum.\\\\nYour gift will help to enhance the learning environment for our current scholars and ensure that more scholars in Northwest Arkansas will bene t from the free, accelerated, college-preparatory experience that Haas Hall Academy has offered for the past 12 years.\\\\nSupport the Ingenuity Center with your gift.\\\\nThe Ingenuity Center will serve the Haas Hall Academy community with specialized, state-of-the-art learning spaces intended to promote interactive educational opportunities for all scholars. \\\\nYour gifts turn this vision into a reality.\\\\n“The additional classroom space will allow our exceptional faculty to teach classes that they do not have the space or resources to do in our current location,”\\\\xa0said Dr. Martin W. Schoppmeyer, Jr. “Given the limited funds provided to charter schools in Arkansas, the need for private support to give our scholars the experience they desire is a necessity.”\\\\nWe ask that you consider a legacy gift to permanently support the Ingenuity Center at Haas Hall Academy. A naming gift places your imprint on the Ingenuity Center and secures a hands-on learning experience for Haas Hall Academy scholars. For more information about how legacy gifts are used, please contact \\\\nStacy Keenan\\\\n.\\\\nNamed gifts may pay tribute to – or memorialize – individuals, organizations, or a cause.

Before I came to this school, I went going to a boarding school in India for two years, and I barely thought about my future—where I’m going to go to college or what I want to be when I grow up. Then, I came to Haas, and I found out how hard I really have to work to get into a good college and be successful in life. I like how this school has a small environment, and I don’t think I would have gotten the same experience if I had gone to a larger school.\\\\nThe teachers are a big reason why I choose to stay in this school rather than go to a different one. I probably wouldn’t have gotten as much individual attention if I had gone to another school. The students are also a big part of why I like this school. They are all very friendly, and I had no trouble making friends. They are also very competitive, which is good because it motivates me to keep up with them and work hard to do better. The students make this school one of the best in the nation, and I feel very lucky to be accepted into this school.\\\\nElijah,\\\\xa0grade 9\\\\n“I am always getting pushed and encouraged by teachers, classmates, and my parents to strive to be my best. If I don’t get an A, I know I have back up at Haas Hall. It is a place where I learn a lot from everyone around me.”\\\\nRead More\\\\nNicole,\\\\xa0graduated 2014\\\\n“After making the switch (to Haas Hall) I no longer dreaded the next school day. Instead, I was curious and interested to see what school may offer me each day. I threw myself into all kinds of activities and really found my niche. I finally felt like school mattered.”\\\\nRead More\\\\nNathan,\\\\xa0grade 9\\\\n“Haas Hall is a small but friendly community of people who love to learn and teach. Haas offers a variety of classes to take, so anybody can have the perfect educational experience. With the personalized scheduling at Haas, I was able to take Chemistry and Algebra 2 in my eighth-grade year, which I would be difficult to do anywhere else.”\\\\nRead More\\\\nShare this:\\\\nFacebook\\\\nTwitter\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nGoogle\\\\nEmail\\\\nPrint\\\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\n   |   \\\\nSchools\\\\n   |   \\\\nContact Us\\\\n   |   \\\\nNewsletter\\\\n   |   \\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n   |   \\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\\\nSend to Email Address\\\\nYour Name\\\\nYour Email Address\\\\nCancel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\'), (\\'https://www.haashall.org/contact-us/\\', \\'False\\', \\'2\\', \\', \\\\nsite translator\\\\n, \\\\nautomatic translation\\\\n, \\\\nfree translation\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nHome\\\\nContact Us\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tContact Us\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\nAt Haas Hall Academy, excellence in education is not only expected, it is celebrated, through acknowledging the accomplishment of knowing our scholars chose the challenging route and were successful.\\\\nIf you desire an unrivaled college preparatory experience, from an academic community filled with exceptional individuals who have made the important decision to focus on preparing for college, then Haas Hall Academy is what you are seeking.\\\\xa0 We are an educational institution where academics are\\\\xa0first\\\\xa0and foremost.\\\\nCall Us Now\\\\nPhone: \\\\n(479) 966-4930\\\\nGet Updates\\\\nKeep up with all of the new developments at Haas Hall Academy – sign up for our newsletter!\\\\nEmail Address \\\\n*\\\\nFirst Name \\\\nLast Name \\\\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback about our website, please contact the website administrator by filling out the form below and then clicking the Submit button.

It is the only open-enrollment charter school accredited by AdvancED in the state of Arkansas and ranks in the top 5% of all public high schools in the nation.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy produces truly educated graduates ready for the academic challenges that await them in their higher education pursuits.\\\\xa0As a functioning microcosm of a university, scholars complete Carnegie units by semester—not by the year. Our\\\\xa0graduates often tell us their first semester of college was a review because of the intensive preparation they received while attending Haas Hall Academy.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy is the accelerated college preparatory choice for students with high intensity of purpose.\\\\nNorthwest Arkansas has become one of the fastest growing parts of the country. Unfortunately in northwest Arkansas there is little choice in public education for parents and scholars seeking a small, personalized academic environment with a rigorous, college-prep curriculum.\\\\nThe state of Arkansas trails most of the country in preparing its graduating seniors for freshman level classes at a university. Just 17% of Arkansas graduating seniors are prepared for the rigors of college with a mere 6 states lagging behind Arkansas. 54.3% of entering college Freshmen in the state of Arkansas must take remedial courses because they scored an 18 or below on the American College Testing (ACT) program examination. Arkansas spent $53.8 million remediating students in 2007—the equivalent of the combined budgets of seven (7) community colleges.\\\\nNationally, we lose $17 billion annually on lost productivity and remedial education in post-secondary institutions and the workplace for skills that should have been learned in high school. 76% of college students who take remedial courses in reading never earn a degree. 63% of college students who take remedial courses in math never earn a degree.\\\\nShare this:\\\\nFacebook\\\\nTwitter\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nGoogle\\\\nEmail\\\\nPrint\\\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\n   |   \\\\nSchools\\\\n   |   \\\\nContact Us\\\\n   |   \\\\nNewsletter\\\\n   |   \\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n   |   \\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\\\nSend to Email Address\\\\nYour Name\\\\nYour Email Address\\\\nCancel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPost was not sent -

Your curriculum at Haas Hall Academy will be focused on your intended college major.\\\\nAs a microcosm of a university, scholars at Haas Hall Academy earn a full Carnegie unit of academic credit per semester. Our scholars are able to complete two years of mathematics, science, history, art, etc., in one calendar year.\\\\nScholars complete courses by academic ability not by grade level. English is the only exception. Our scholars take an entire year of literature and language each calendar year. This ensures our scholars are well read and can write well.\\\\nBy definition, Haas Hall Academy’s curriculum is immersed in technology. Haas Hall Academy incorporates technology into all of its classical secondary school subjects.\\\\nWith small class sizes, we provide unparalleled one-on-one instruction. Our superintendent personally connects with every scholar and parent to assess academic goals and aspirations.\\\\nOur course offerings parallel the requirements of largely private preparatory schools. Haas Hall Academy produces a truly educated graduate prepared for the academic challenges that will await them in their higher educational pursuits.\\\\nThe Importance of College Preparation\\\\nThe state of Arkansas trails most of the country in preparing its graduating seniors for freshman level classes at a university. Haas Hall takes pride in producing truly prepared graduates.\\\\nJust 17% of Arkansas graduating seniors are prepared for the rigors of college with a mere 6 states lagging behind Arkansas.\\\\n54.3% of entering college Freshmen in the state of Arkansas score an 18 or below on their ACT, resulting in required remedial courses.\\\\nEvery year, Arkansas spends $65 million to remediate students who are admitted to college but who lack basic academic skills. This is the equivalent of the combined budgets of seven (7) community colleges.\\\\nNationally, we lose $17 billion annually on lost productivity and remedial education in post-secondary institutions and the workplace for skills that should have been learned in high school.\\\\n76% of college students who take remedial courses in reading never earn a degree.\\\\n63% of college students who take remedial courses in math never earn a degree.\\\\nWhy a Math & Science-based Education?\\\\nThe answer is really quite simple—to ensure the future academic success of your child!\\\\nExtensive research has proven that students who have taken more demanding science & math courses in high school are better prepared for college and work. In college the stumbling blocks for the vast majority of undergraduate students are their required math and science courses.\\\\nSadly, many students have not been prepared in high school for introductory science and math courses and are quickly faced with the rude awakening that they were not adequately prepared for college.\\\\n“Students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as likely to graduate from college compared to students with less mathematical preparation.”\\\\xa0—\\\\xa02008 U.S. Department’s Final Report of the Mathematics Advisory Panel\\\\nObtaining a college degree is a unique investment. You can determine the rate of return based upon your major. Students who major in fields that emphasize mathematics can expect to see a higher rate of return on their investment than those who choose other majors.\\\\xa0According to the\\\\xa0National\\\\xa0Association of Colleges and Employers, all 15 college majors with the highest earnings potential rely on mathematics skills.\\\\n“Math is at the crux of who gets paid, If you have those skills, you are an extremely valuable asset.” — Ed Koc, Director of Research at NACE.\\\\nShare this:\\\\nFacebook\\\\nTwitter\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nGoogle\\\\nEmail\\\\nPrint\\\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\\\nHaas Hall Academy\\\\n   |   \\\\nSchools\\\\n   |   \\\\nContact Us\\\\n   |   \\\\nNewsletter\\\\n   |   \\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n   |   \\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\\\nSend to Email Address\\\\nYour Name\\\\nYour Email Address\\\\nCancel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\'), (\\'https://www.haashall.org/admissions/shadow-a-scholar/\\', \\'False\\', \\'1\\', \\', \\\\nsite translator\\\\n, \\\\nautomatic translation\\\\n, \\\\nfree translation\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWelcome to Haas Hall\\\\nScholars\\\\nParents\\\\nFaculty\\\\nEmployment\\\\nState-Required Information\\\\nAcademic Focus\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nAccreditation\\\\nOur Goals\\\\nGraduate Success\\\\nCampuses\\\\nBentonville, AR\\\\nFayetteville, AR\\\\nRogers, AR\\\\nSpringdale, AR\\\\nFundraising\\\\nContribute\\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\nIngenuity Center\\\\nMake a Donation!\\\\nSCHOLAR LIFE\\\\nAcademics\\\\nCurriculum\\\\nDistrict Calendar\\\\nTechnology\\\\nCollege & Academic Advising\\\\nGraduation\\\\nNews\\\\nCulture\\\\nArts\\\\nAthletics\\\\nDining\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nADMISSIONS\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nOur Process\\\\nFAQ\\\\nDeclaration of Interest\\\\nHomeschool\\\\nApplication for Admission\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\nLottery Results\\\\nPARENTS\\\\nParents\\\\nResources\\\\nParental Involvement\\\\nParent Faculty Council\\\\nHandbook\\\\nDress Code\\\\nPolicies & Procedures\\\\nNews\\\\nDashboard\\\\nCalendar\\\\nTransportation\\\\nAnnouncements\\\\nWeekly Schedule\\\\nDirectory\\\\nUniform Exchange\\\\nGrades\\\\nVolunteer\\\\nRegister\\\\nLogin\\\\nCONTACT\\\\n|\\\\nHome\\\\nAdmissions\\\\nShadow a Scholar\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tShadow a Scholar\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nWe would like to thank you for considering Haas Hall Academy as the next step in your child’s academic career. \\\\xa0The Haas Hall Academy community is an exceptional group of individuals who have made the important decision to focus on preparation for college.\\\\nYour first impression of Haas Hall will be that it doesn’t feel or function like a traditional school but rather a place of business.\\\\xa0 The environment is one of academic enlightenment.\\\\xa0 A place where scholars have made the important choice to be a part of our academic community.\\\\xa0 Because they made that choice, they respect each other and honor the learning process.\\\\nAll prospective scholars may arrange a shadow date\\\\xa0the year prior to their attendance\\\\xa0at Haas Hall Academy.

Read our frequently asked questions.\\\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\\\nAbout Haas Hall Academy\\\\nWhat are the requirements for admission to Haas Hall Academy?\\\\nHaas Hall Academy is an accelerated, rigorous math and science based college preparatory open-enrollment charter school serving grades 7-12 for scholars with a high intensity of purpose.\\\\nOur curriculum is geared toward scholars seeking to focus in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. Our educational philosophy is to expose and prepare our scholars now for the rigorous mathematics and science content they will be exposed to in college.\\\\nAny child, grade 7-12, who is not currently expelled from another school may attend Haas Hall Academy. Test scores, grades, or special needs are not considered\\\\xa0in any way as part of the admissions process or lottery.\\\\nHow do I apply for admission to Haas Hall Academy?\\\\nThe 2017-2018 application window opens on September 5, 2017. Applications will be accepted for the 2017-2018 school year\\\\xa0until\\\\xa0February 4, 2018. No additional applications will be accepted after February 4, 2018.\\\\nSeptember 5, 2017\\\\nThe application window opens for the 2018-2019\\\\xa0admissions lottery. Applications will be accepted until\\\\xa0February 4, 2018.\\\\nFebruary 4, 2018\\\\nApplication window closes for the 2018-2019\\\\xa0admissions lottery. No applications will be accepted after this date.\\\\nDownload a copy of the \\\\n2018-2019 Admissions Calendar\\\\nOnce an application is submitted, it is entered into the application database and assigned a unique application identification number. At the close of the admissions window, all applications are exported and looked over for accuracy in preparation for the lottery drawing.\\\\nDo you charge tuition?\\\\nHaas Hall Academy is an open-enrollment public charter school. We do not charge tuition.\\\\nDo you offer Shadow Days for prospective Scholars?\\\\nYes! Haas Hall Academy invites prospective scholars\\\\xa0to spend a day shadowing\\\\xa0the year prior to their attendance\\\\xa0at Haas Hall Academy. Prospective scholars will attend classes alongside a current scholar and experience the unique Haas Hall Academy culture, schedule, and social environment first hand.\\\\nOn that day, parents of prospective scholars are invited to tour the campus.\\\\nShadows are taken by appointment, staring late Fall (October).\\\\nDownload a copy of the \\\\n2018-2019 Admissions Calendar\\\\n.\\\\nAre campus-to-campus transfers permitted?\\\\nNo campus-to-campus transfers are permitted. If your scholar is admitted to a campus in the lottery drawing, they must accept or decline their seat at that campus. Our application process allows for more than one campus to be selected so that scholars may be entered in the lottery for multiple campuses. If a scholar receives a seat at multiple campuses, the scholar may only choose to accept their seat at one campus.\\\\nFor Example: A Seventh-grade applicant living in Springdale is awarded seat number 14 at the Fayetteville campus, seat number 3 at the Bentonville campus, and is not awarded a seat at the Springdale campus. Regardless of residency, the applicant\\\\xa0must choose between the two seats at the Fayetteville and Bentonville campuses and decline whichever he decides not to attend.\\\\xa0\\\\nThe Application Process\\\\nWhat is the Haas Hall Academy Admissions Lottery?\\\\nHaas Hall Academy conducts a random, anonymous lottery for each campus by grade. Representatives from the Arkansas Department of Education and the public are invited to attend. In order to protect the privacy of all applicants, the applicant’s Lottery ID number will be used to identify scholars during the lottery drawing instead of names.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy utilizes a system which features a random number generator formula that assigns random selection for each applicant. The number list produced by the random number generator is then sorted in ascending order.\\\\nDuring the 2016-2017 admissions lottery, over\\\\xa01200\\\\xa0applications were submitted for only\\\\xa0145\\\\xa0seats. Scholars who did not gain admission were put on the school’s wait list.\\\\nScholars on the wait list who do not gain admission during a lottery cycle must\\\\xa0re-apply for the next\\\\xa0school year after the application window opens.\\\\nWaitlist Procedure\\\\nHaas Hall Academy utilizes a random lottery system which features a random number generator formula that assigns random selection for each applicant. The number list produced by the random number generator is then sorted in ascending order.\\\\xa0If more scholars apply than spots are available, then a waitlist number is assigned.\\\\nFollowing the lottery drawing, the waitlist tracker is\\\\xa0updated weekly on haashall.org which indicates the waitlist number\\\\xa0being admitted if any. This tracker serves as a great tool to stay updated as we continue to process enrollment.\\\\nScholars on the wait list who do not gain admission during a lottery cycle must\\\\xa0re-apply for the next\\\\xa0school year after the application window opens.\\\\nWhat happens after the lottery drawing?\\\\nApplicants will be notified by email the day following the lottery to indicate their scholar’s acceptance or waiting list position. For those accepted under the random lottery process, Haas Hall Academy will send an email link to an electronic form where they can accept or deny their scholar’s seat. Once the form is electronically signed, the signature is assigned a tracking number.\\\\nFor those not accepted under the random lottery process, Haas Hall Academy will send an email with the scholar’s waitlist status. The parent will be encouraged to re-apply for the following school year’s lottery when the application window opens and will receive periodic reminders of important lottery dates throughout the year.\\\\nDo I need to submit an application if my scholar has a sibling at Haas Hall Academy? \\\\nYes. All students interested in attending\\\\xa0Haas Hall Academy\\\\xa0must submit an application by the deadline provided.\\\\xa0Siblings receive priority at the campus their sibling currently attends during the 2018-2019 lottery cycle. There is a section on the application for admission to identify\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0applicant’s sibling.\\\\nPreference is given to siblings of current scholars, as well as\\\\xa0children of faculty members.\\\\nFor example, if there are 32 spots open in the 7th Grade at the Bentonville campus with 1 faculty child applicant and 12 sibling applicants, one seat is reserved for a faculty member’s child,\\\\xa0twelve are reserved for sibling applicants, and 19 seats will be filled and the remaining applicants will be placed on the wait list.\\\\nDoes my current scholar need to re-apply each year?\\\\nNo. Enrolled scholars do not need to re-apply each year to continue attending Haas Hall Academy.\\\\nI\\'m not sure if my application went through. Should I submit another?\\\\nIf you are unsure about the status of your application, please use our \\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\n to locate your applicant’s Lottery ID number(s).\\\\nIf you are unable to find an application after searching using the\\\\xa0\\\\nLottery ID Finder\\\\n, please \\\\nenter a new application\\\\n.\\\\nIf you are unable to enter an application, please contact us at \\\\nadmissions@haashall.org\\\\n.\\\\nI applied in the past. Do I need to re-apply?\\\\nYou must re-apply for your scholar to be considered for the lottery each year that your applicant is interested in attending.\\\\xa0If you applied for admission in the past and were not admitted, you must re-apply.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy is an accelerated, rigorous math and science based college-preparatory open-enrollment charter school serving grades 7-12 for scholars with high intensity of purpose. Haas Hall Academy has been recognized by U.S. News and World Report as one of the finest high schools in the nation!\\\\nWe would like to thank you for considering Haas Hall Academy as the next step in your child’s academic career by joining the exceptional group of individuals who have made the important decision to focus on preparation for college.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy does not discriminate on the basis of sex, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, academic or athletic eligibility.

I am always getting pushed and encouraged by teachers, classmates, and my parents to strive to be my best. If I don’t get an A, I know I have back up at Haas Hall. It is a place where I learn a lot from everyone around me.\\\\nAlso, Haas Hall is a small community, so pretty much everybody knows everybody. It has a friendly atmosphere. Eighth graders are friends with seniors. Students know teachers that they may not have for a class, and it is very much a small-town atmosphere. Everybody is included and has a group to fit into.\\\\nNicole, graduated 2014\\\\n“After making the switch (to Haas Hall) I no longer dreaded the next school day.

It is a small but friendly community of people who love to learn and to teach. Haas offers a variety of classes to take, so anybody can have the perfect educational experience. With the personalized scheduling at Haas, I was able to take Chemistry and Algebra 2 in my eighth-grade year, which I would be difficult to do anywhere else.\\\\nHaas Hall Academy also has a large selection of clubs and other extracurricular activities. Here, anybody can find something they will enjoy. I run cross-country and compete in Quiz Bowl. These activities not only give me things to do after school, but also help me meet new people and make new friends. All in all, Haas Hall is a great school for anyone who loves to learn.\\\\nMaddy, graduated 2014\\\\n“The atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper.

The accreditation process is also known in terms of its ability to effectively drive student performance and continuous improvement in education. But such definitions, though accurate, are incomplete.

But such definitions, though accurate, are incomplete.\\\\nWhile accreditation is a set of rigorous protocols and research-based processes for evaluating an institution’s organizational effectiveness, it is far more than that.

Fund\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nHaas Hall Academy’s rich and diverse academic\\\\xa0offerings are largely made possible by the generous gifts received to our Annual Fund.\\\\nYour support is essential to the success of Haas Hall Academy’s scholars, faculty & future.\\\\nParents, alumni, faculty, grandparents, and friends of the school are encouraged to contribute to the Annual Fund. \\\\xa0\\\\nMAKE A GIFT\\\\nHaas Hall Academy’s Annual Fund directly supports the innovative, academic programs that have made our institution one of the finest in the nation. Unfortunately, charter schools in Arkansas receive the state minimum per child, but do not receive any additional monies from local millages. The Annual Fund closes the gap in public school funding inequalities and ensures our academic offerings provide the experiences and challenges necessary to ready our students\\\\xa0for the academic challenges that await them in their higher education pursuits.\\\\nParents, alumni, faculty, grandparents, and friends of the school are encouraged to contribute to the Annual Fund. The 2016-2017 Annual Fund goal is $200,000. Please consider making a donation this year to help us reach that goal.\\\\nVisionary\\\\n$15,000 and up\\\\nPrincipal\\\\n$1,000 - $2,499\\\\nValedictorian\\\\n$10,000 - $14,999\\\\nAdvocate\\\\n$500 - $999\\\\nTop of the Class\\\\n$5,000 - $9,999\\\\nPartner\\\\n$100 - $499\\\\nDean\\'s List\\\\n$2,500 - $4,999\\\\nFriend\\\\nUp to $99\\\\n The Annual Fund goal is $200,000.\\\\nEvery gift, of every size, makes an impact.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\nMAKE A GIFT\\\\nWHY IS MY PARTICIPATION IMPORTANT?\\\\nHaas Hall Academy is a young institution, established in 2004. With a small constituency,\\\\xa0particularly when compared to other traditional public schools, gifts of any size have an even greater impact on the school and are\\\\xa0crucial to our future external funding endeavors.\\\\xa0Participation in the \\\\nAnnual Fund\\\\n\\\\xa0is as important as the actual value of the gift.\\\\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I GIVE?\\\\nGiven the importance of the Annual Fund to the quality and excellence of Haas Hall Academy, we ask that you give as generously as you can. The school community is extremely grateful to everyone who contributes, as each gift is critical to the success of the Annual Fund. Pledge and receive recognition as part of\\\\xa0The Charter Society, which recognizes donors at various levels.\\\\nYour gift will allow us to provide the finest education for all our students. In addition, our eligibility for grants and matching funds is based, in part, on the level of donor participation of our community.\\\\nIS MY GIFT TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?\\\\nAll donations to the Haas Hall Academy Foundation are fully tax-deductible provided you do not receive any goods or services in return. Receipts are issued for all gifts. The Haas Hall Academy Fund accepts gifts of cash, credit or debit cards, stocks, or securities and bequests.\\\\nIt is helpful to know that in a highly appreciated market, a charitable stock gift can offer additional tax advantages.\\\\nCAN I PLEDGE NOW AND PAY LATER?\\\\nThe school’s fiscal year runs from July 1st to June 30th. Pledges can be paid at any time and may be paid in installments.\\\\nHOW DO I MAKE MY GIFT?\\\\nMake a Donation\\\\nMake a Donation\\\\nYour tax-deductible donation\\\\xa0provides the flexibility to meet the needs of over 1,000 scholars.\\\\n MAKE A GIFT\\\\nThank you to the Families & Friends of Haas Hall Academy who have gotten our Annual Fund Campaign off to an excellent start!\\\\nVisionary\\\\nAnonymous\\\\nBillie Jo Starr\\\\nWalmart Foundation\\\\nWalton Family Foundation\\\\nAdd your name to this list. \\\\nMake a Gift\\\\n today!\\\\nValedictorian\\\\nRenee & J.P.
