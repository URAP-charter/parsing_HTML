In Northwest Arkansas the discrepancy in funding is substantial. For the 2015-2016 school year, funding levels for our schools were as follows:\\nHaas Hall Academy Needs Your Support\\nHaas Hall Academy’s rich and diverse academic\\xa0offerings are largely made possible by the generous gifts received throughout the year.\\nDonations to fundraising events, the Annual Fund Campaign, matching gifts, the \\nIngenuity Center\\n, and special campaigns enable us to provide our scholars with the finest, accelerated college preparatory education in the state of Arkansas.\\nHaas Hall Academy receives the state minimum per child, but does not receive additional monies for facilities and ancillary programs that local millages provide for traditional public schools. Your support is essential to our continued success.\\n Contribute to Haas Hall Academy\\nMajor Gifts\\nPrivate support makes a significant difference in the daily lives of our scholars. For example, in the fall of 2015, Haas Hall Academy named our new Fayetteville campus— The Starr Scholar Center\\xa0—after Billie Jo Starr, a great champion of education who has done so much to enrich the quality of life in Northwest Arkansas and specifically, the city of Fayetteville.\\nMrs. Starr’s financial commitment to provide all new furnishings for this location is a gift that our scholars and faculty enjoy everyday. The Starr family’s generosity has allowed our faculty, staff, and scholars to feel like they are valued and deserve a well-appointed environment to match their exceptional level of performance in the classroom.\\n Contribute to Haas Hall Academy\\nAnnual Fund\\nAnnual giving by families and friends of Haas Hall Academy is a vital part of our development program. Unrestricted gifts provide a crucial bridge between state funds and the actual cost of running Haas Hall Academy.\\nGiving to the Annual Fund allows the school to respond to pressing needs and to provide the flexibility to meet the changing needs of our scholars and the School.\\nExamples of how Annual Fund gifts are used include updating technology, assisting faculty with classroom materials, and professional development. Funds are also used to support scholars who need assistance purchasing uniforms, school lunches, and AP testing fees.\\nOur financial strength is dependent on the participation of our entire school community. Your participation generates enthusiasm and encourages other to join you in supporting the School.\\nParents, alumni, faculty, grandparents, and friends of the school are encouraged to contribute to the Annual Fund.\\nThe 2016 Annual Fund goal is $200,000\\n Contribute Now\\nMatching Gifts\\n600+ companies nationwide match their employee’s contributions to secondary schools. \\nFIND OUT IF YOUR COMPANY MATCHES!\\nPlease take advantage of the company privilege by obtaining a Matching Gift application from your personnel office and sending it with your contribution to Haas Hall Academy. We will process the form immediately, and Haas Hall Academy will be the beneficiary of your generosity and that of your company.\\nNot sure if your company matches gifts? \\nCheck here!\\nShare this:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nGoogle\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\nHaas Hall Academy\\n   |   \\nSchools\\n   |   \\nContact Us\\n   |   \\nNewsletter\\n   |   \\nPrivacy Policy\\n   |   \\nTerms & Conditions\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\nSend to Email Address\\nYour Name\\nYour Email Address\\nCancel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

Although Arkansas’s economy is largely driven by agriculture, the Northwest Arkansas region is the headquarters of Tyson Foods (one of the largest meat-producing companies in the world), J.B. Hunt (one of the country’s largest transportation companies), and Walmart (a global leader in retail). The local corporate offices of over 1,200 Walmart vendors bring highly educated employees of companies like Coca-Cola, Dell, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Pfizer, PepsiCo, and Procter & Gamble to the area. \\xa0\\nThe 2012 US Census estimates the population of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers Metropolitan Area to be over 480,000, and the current growth rate ranges from 2percent to 4 percent per year.\\nThe School\\nHaas Hall Academy is a small, comprehensive institution promoting an accelerated college preparatory curriculum and serving scholars in grades 7 through 12. \\xa0Haas Hall Academy is the state’s only open-enrollment charter high school focusing on rigor and high academic standards.

Don’t get me wrong, my grades were pretty good, but they didn’t matter much to me. Sometimes I would write essays that, though pages and pages long, felt totally empty… a thousand words from my head that meant nothing to me. It was exhausting.\\nAfter making the switch, I was elated to discover a change in my attitude. I no longer dreaded the next school day. Instead, I was curious and interested to see what school may offer me each day. I threw myself into all kinds of activities and really found my niche. I finally felt like school mattered.\\nAt Haas Hall, there is always something to be done and something to look forward to. Switching schools meant a few days of anxiety and at least a week of mild apprehension. But, as my nerves subsided, I found that they were promptly replaced with joy.\\nMaddy, graduated 2014\\n“The atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper.

This school has become much more to me, however, than simply a transitional place.\\nThe atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper. Acheivement in academics is always encouraged and rewarded, not just by the school, but by the competitive nature of the student body. Because of the small classes and block schedule, it is easy to become fully engaged within the classroom and intensely focused on each area of interest. My teachers truly care about my success, both during my time at Haas Hall and beyond, and several teachers have gone out of their way to ensure that I understand individual concepts.\\nMost importantly, however, is the feeling of responsibility shared by the scholars at this school. We are humbled by our role in contributing to the success of the #1 Public High School in Arkansas, and we strive to continue to make our teachers, school, and state proud.\\nElijah,\\xa0grade 9\\n“I am always getting pushed and encouraged by teachers, classmates, and my parents to strive to be my best.

The Haas Hall family is a very close one because you see the same people and talk to the same people every day. When you go to a small school, it is easy to make friends, to know and be known by others, and (most importantly) to flourish academically.\\nNathan,\\xa0grade 9\\n“Haas Hall is a small but friendly community of people who love to learn and teach. Haas offers a variety of classes to take, so anybody can have the perfect educational experience. With the personalized scheduling at Haas, I was able to take Chemistry and Algebra 2 in my eighth-grade year, which I would be difficult to do anywhere else.”\\nRead More\\nMaddy,\\xa0graduated 2014\\n“The atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper. Acheivement in academics is always encouraged and rewarded, not just by the school, but by the competitive nature of the student body.”\\nRead More\\nGanesh,\\xa0sophomore\\n“When I came to this school, it was the smallest school I had ever been to, and I thought to myself, ‘How can this be the best school in Arkansas?’\\xa0I came to Haas and I found out how hard I really have to work to get into a good college and be successful in life.”\\nRead More\\nShare this:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nGoogle\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\nHaas Hall Academy\\n   |   \\nSchools\\n   |   \\nContact Us\\n   |   \\nNewsletter\\n   |   \\nPrivacy Policy\\n   |   \\nTerms & Conditions\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\nSend to Email Address\\nYour Name\\nYour Email Address\\nCancel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

Haas Hall Academy holds two prestigious academic events each year the day after Memorial Day, Convocation and Hall of Honors ceremonies. These two significant events are the culmination of years of hard work, persistence, and the respect of the dynamic partnership from all stakeholders which embodies the educational endeavor. There is an uncompromising level of satisfaction knowing our scholars took the challenging route and were extremely successful.\\nConvocation is a celebration of scholarship.\\nThis significant accomplishment embodies the complete scholar. Our graduates have earned the right to call themselves Haas Hall Academy alumni. Scholars, parents and faculty take great pride in the unparalled level of preparation our scholars receive at Haas Hall Academy for their higher educational pursuits.\\nThe Hall of Honors Induction Ceremony provides an opportunity for our academic community to recognize scholars of proven academic ability who desire intellectual challenge and the opportunity for creative interaction in a highly personalized teaching environment in a specific course. These scholars exhibit excellent conduct and a demonstrated ability to work well with and assist others. These scholars are accurate and prompt with homework, have spotless attendance records and are active participants in the classroom.\\nThese two ceremonies provide a public venue for all in our community to see the results of our uncompromising, accelerated college-preparatory academic programs which have given Haas Hall Academy national accolades. Haas Hall Academy is a multiple national award-winning model of how a charter school can strengthen communities, inspire innovation and be a catalyst for the renewal of expectations for public education.

In our resolve to ensure a safe, secure and disciplined learning environment, we believe that the establishment of a uniform dress code is a fundamental aspect of this effort.

Haas Hall Academy attracts scholars from 19 school districts, six private schools and a large home school base, therefore our uniforms are our community’s identity. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the potential benefits of a uniform dress code are: decreasing violence and theft — even life-threatening situations — among students over designer clothing or expensive sneakers; helping prevent gang members from wearing gang colors and insignia at school; instilling students with discipline; helping parents and students resist peer pressure; helping students concentrate on their school work; and helping school officials recognize intruders who come to the school.\\nView Uniform Style & Color Options\\nLand’s End: Haas Hall Academy’s Web Portal \\n–\\xa0Purchase your Scholar’s Uniforms Online\\nDownload the 2016 – 2017 Dress Code Policy\\nPolicies & Procedures\\nAHERA Inspection and Management Plan\\nSchool Board Policies\\nPersonnel Policies (Licensed/Classified)\\nMedia Policy\\nWe ask that all media requests (via telephone, fax, or e-mail) be directed to \\nCarin Schoppmeyer\\n, Director of School-Community Relations, who will promptly respond to your request either by e-mail at or by phone.

Before I came to this school, I went going to a boarding school in India for two years, and I barely thought about my future—where I’m going to go to college or what I want to be when I grow up. Then, I came to Haas, and I found out how hard I really have to work to get into a good college and be successful in life. I like how this school has a small environment, and I don’t think I would have gotten the same experience if I had gone to a larger school.\\nThe teachers are a big reason why I choose to stay in this school rather than go to a different one. I probably wouldn’t have gotten as much individual attention if I had gone to another school. The students are also a big part of why I like this school. They are all very friendly, and I had no trouble making friends. They are also very competitive, which is good because it motivates me to keep up with them and work hard to do better. The students make this school one of the best in the nation, and I feel very lucky to be accepted into this school.\\nElijah,\\xa0grade 9\\n“I am always getting pushed and encouraged by teachers, classmates, and my parents to strive to be my best. If I don’t get an A, I know I have back up at Haas Hall. It is a place where I learn a lot from everyone around me.”\\nRead More\\nNicole,\\xa0graduated 2014\\n“After making the switch (to Haas Hall) I no longer dreaded the next school day. Instead, I was curious and interested to see what school may offer me each day. I threw myself into all kinds of activities and really found my niche. I finally felt like school mattered.”\\nRead More\\nNathan,\\xa0grade 9\\n“Haas Hall is a small but friendly community of people who love to learn and teach. Haas offers a variety of classes to take, so anybody can have the perfect educational experience. With the personalized scheduling at Haas, I was able to take Chemistry and Algebra 2 in my eighth-grade year, which I would be difficult to do anywhere else.”\\nRead More\\nShare this:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nGoogle\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\nHaas Hall Academy\\n   |   \\nSchools\\n   |   \\nContact Us\\n   |   \\nNewsletter\\n   |   \\nPrivacy Policy\\n   |   \\nTerms & Conditions\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\nSend to Email Address\\nYour Name\\nYour Email Address\\nCancel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

Unfortunately in northwest Arkansas there is little choice in public education for parents and scholars seeking a small, personalized academic environment with a rigorous, college-prep curriculum.\\nThe state of Arkansas trails most of the country in preparing its graduating seniors for freshman level classes at a university. Just 17% of Arkansas graduating seniors are prepared for the rigors of college with a mere 6 states lagging behind Arkansas. 54.3% of entering college Freshmen in the state of Arkansas must take remedial courses because they scored an 18 or below on the American College Testing (ACT) program examination. Arkansas spent $53.8 million remediating students in 2007—the equivalent of the combined budgets of seven (7) community colleges.\\nNationally, we lose $17 billion annually on lost productivity and remedial education in post-secondary institutions and the workplace for skills that should have been learned in high school. 76% of college students who take remedial courses in reading never earn a degree. 63% of college students who take remedial courses in math never earn a degree.\\nShare this:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nGoogle\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\nHaas Hall Academy\\n   |   \\nSchools\\n   |   \\nContact Us\\n   |   \\nNewsletter\\n   |   \\nPrivacy Policy\\n   |   \\nTerms & Conditions\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\nSend to Email Address\\nYour Name\\nYour Email Address\\nCancel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

Your curriculum at Haas Hall Academy will be focused on your intended college major.\\nAs a microcosm of a university, scholars at Haas Hall Academy earn a full Carnegie unit of academic credit per semester. Our scholars are able to complete two years of mathematics, science, history, art, etc., in one calendar year.\\nScholars complete courses by academic ability not by grade level. English is the only exception. Our scholars take an entire year of literature and language each calendar year. This ensures our scholars are well read and can write well.\\nBy definition, Haas Hall Academy’s curriculum is immersed in technology. Haas Hall Academy incorporates technology into all of its classical secondary school subjects.\\nWith small class sizes, we provide unparalleled one-on-one instruction. Our superintendent personally connects with every scholar and parent to assess academic goals and aspirations.\\nOur course offerings parallel the requirements of largely private preparatory schools. Haas Hall Academy produces a truly educated graduate prepared for the academic challenges that will await them in their higher educational pursuits.\\nThe Importance of College Preparation\\nThe state of Arkansas trails most of the country in preparing its graduating seniors for freshman level classes at a university. Haas Hall takes pride in producing truly prepared graduates.\\nJust 17% of Arkansas graduating seniors are prepared for the rigors of college with a mere 6 states lagging behind Arkansas.\\n54.3% of entering college Freshmen in the state of Arkansas score an 18 or below on their ACT, resulting in required remedial courses.\\nEvery year, Arkansas spends $65 million to remediate students who are admitted to college but who lack basic academic skills. This is the equivalent of the combined budgets of seven (7) community colleges.\\nNationally, we lose $17 billion annually on lost productivity and remedial education in post-secondary institutions and the workplace for skills that should have been learned in high school.\\n76% of college students who take remedial courses in reading never earn a degree.\\n63% of college students who take remedial courses in math never earn a degree.\\nWhy a Math & Science-based Education?\\nThe answer is really quite simple—to ensure the future academic success of your child!\\nExtensive research has proven that students who have taken more demanding science & math courses in high school are better prepared for college and work. In college the stumbling blocks for the vast majority of undergraduate students are their required math and science courses.\\nSadly, many students have not been prepared in high school for introductory science and math courses and are quickly faced with the rude awakening that they were not adequately prepared for college.\\n“Students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as likely to graduate from college compared to students with less mathematical preparation.”\\xa0—\\xa02008 U.S. Department’s Final Report of the Mathematics Advisory Panel\\nObtaining a college degree is a unique investment. You can determine the rate of return based upon your major. Students who major in fields that emphasize mathematics can expect to see a higher rate of return on their investment than those who choose other majors.\\xa0According to the\\xa0National\\xa0Association of Colleges and Employers, all 15 college majors with the highest earnings potential rely on mathematics skills.\\n“Math is at the crux of who gets paid, If you have those skills, you are an extremely valuable asset.” — Ed Koc, Director of Research at NACE.\\nShare this:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nGoogle\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\nHaas Hall Academy\\n   |   \\nSchools\\n   |   \\nContact Us\\n   |   \\nNewsletter\\n   |   \\nPrivacy Policy\\n   |   \\nTerms & Conditions\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\nSend to Email Address\\nYour Name\\nYour Email Address\\nCancel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

Read our frequently asked questions.\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\nAbout Haas Hall Academy\\nWhat are the requirements for admission to Haas Hall Academy?\\nHaas Hall Academy is an accelerated, rigorous math and science based college preparatory open-enrollment charter school serving grades 7-12 for scholars with a high intensity of purpose.\\nOur curriculum is geared toward scholars seeking to focus in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. Our educational philosophy is to expose and prepare our scholars now for the rigorous mathematics and science content they will be exposed to in college.\\nAny child, grade 7-12, who is not currently expelled from another school may attend Haas Hall Academy. Test scores, grades, or special needs are not considered\\xa0in any way as part of the admissions process or lottery.\\nHow do I apply for admission to Haas Hall Academy?\\nThe 2017-2018 application window opens on September 5, 2017. Applications will be accepted for the 2017-2018 school year\\xa0until\\xa0February 4, 2018. No additional applications will be accepted after February 4, 2018.\\nSeptember 5, 2017\\nThe application window opens for the 2018-2019\\xa0admissions lottery. Applications will be accepted until\\xa0February 4, 2018.\\nFebruary 4, 2018\\nApplication window closes for the 2018-2019\\xa0admissions lottery. No applications will be accepted after this date.\\nDownload a copy of the \\n2018-2019 Admissions Calendar\\nOnce an application is submitted, it is entered into the application database and assigned a unique application identification number. At the close of the admissions window, all applications are exported and looked over for accuracy in preparation for the lottery drawing.\\nDo you charge tuition?\\nHaas Hall Academy is an open-enrollment public charter school. We do not charge tuition.\\nDo you offer Shadow Days for prospective Scholars?\\nYes! Haas Hall Academy invites prospective scholars\\xa0to spend a day shadowing\\xa0the year prior to their attendance\\xa0at Haas Hall Academy. Prospective scholars will attend classes alongside a current scholar and experience the unique Haas Hall Academy culture, schedule, and social environment first hand.\\nOn that day, parents of prospective scholars are invited to tour the campus.\\nShadows are taken by appointment, staring late Fall (October).\\nDownload a copy of the \\n2018-2019 Admissions Calendar\\n.\\nAre campus-to-campus transfers permitted?\\nNo campus-to-campus transfers are permitted. If your scholar is admitted to a campus in the lottery drawing, they must accept or decline their seat at that campus. Our application process allows for more than one campus to be selected so that scholars may be entered in the lottery for multiple campuses. If a scholar receives a seat at multiple campuses, the scholar may only choose to accept their seat at one campus.\\nFor Example: A Seventh-grade applicant living in Springdale is awarded seat number 14 at the Fayetteville campus, seat number 3 at the Bentonville campus, and is not awarded a seat at the Springdale campus. Regardless of residency, the applicant\\xa0must choose between the two seats at the Fayetteville and Bentonville campuses and decline whichever he decides not to attend.\\xa0\\nThe Application Process\\nWhat is the Haas Hall Academy Admissions Lottery?\\nHaas Hall Academy conducts a random, anonymous lottery for each campus by grade. Representatives from the Arkansas Department of Education and the public are invited to attend. In order to protect the privacy of all applicants, the applicant’s Lottery ID number will be used to identify scholars during the lottery drawing instead of names.\\nHaas Hall Academy utilizes a system which features a random number generator formula that assigns random selection for each applicant. The number list produced by the random number generator is then sorted in ascending order.\\nDuring the 2016-2017 admissions lottery, over\\xa01200\\xa0applications were submitted for only\\xa0145\\xa0seats. Scholars who did not gain admission were put on the school’s wait list.\\nScholars on the wait list who do not gain admission during a lottery cycle must\\xa0re-apply for the next\\xa0school year after the application window opens.\\nWaitlist Procedure\\nHaas Hall Academy utilizes a random lottery system which features a random number generator formula that assigns random selection for each applicant. The number list produced by the random number generator is then sorted in ascending order.\\xa0If more scholars apply than spots are available, then a waitlist number is assigned.\\nFollowing the lottery drawing, the waitlist tracker is\\xa0updated weekly on haashall.org which indicates the waitlist number\\xa0being admitted if any. This tracker serves as a great tool to stay updated as we continue to process enrollment.\\nScholars on the wait list who do not gain admission during a lottery cycle must\\xa0re-apply for the next\\xa0school year after the application window opens.\\nWhat happens after the lottery drawing?\\nApplicants will be notified by email the day following the lottery to indicate their scholar’s acceptance or waiting list position. For those accepted under the random lottery process, Haas Hall Academy will send an email link to an electronic form where they can accept or deny their scholar’s seat. Once the form is electronically signed, the signature is assigned a tracking number.\\nFor those not accepted under the random lottery process, Haas Hall Academy will send an email with the scholar’s waitlist status. The parent will be encouraged to re-apply for the following school year’s lottery when the application window opens and will receive periodic reminders of important lottery dates throughout the year.\\nDo I need to submit an application if my scholar has a sibling at Haas Hall Academy? \\nYes. All students interested in attending\\xa0Haas Hall Academy\\xa0must submit an application by the deadline provided.\\xa0Siblings receive priority at the campus their sibling currently attends during the 2018-2019 lottery cycle. There is a section on the application for admission to identify\\xa0the\\xa0applicant’s sibling.\\nPreference is given to siblings of current scholars, as well as\\xa0children of faculty members.\\nFor example, if there are 32 spots open in the 7th Grade at the Bentonville campus with 1 faculty child applicant and 12 sibling applicants, one seat is reserved for a faculty member’s child,\\xa0twelve are reserved for sibling applicants, and 19 seats will be filled and the remaining applicants will be placed on the wait list.\\nDoes my current scholar need to re-apply each year?\\nNo. Enrolled scholars do not need to re-apply each year to continue attending Haas Hall Academy.\\nI'm not sure if my application went through. Should I submit another?\\nIf you are unsure about the status of your application, please use our \\nLottery ID Finder\\n to locate your applicant’s Lottery ID number(s).\\nIf you are unable to find an application after searching using the\\xa0\\nLottery ID Finder\\n, please \\nenter a new application\\n.\\nIf you are unable to enter an application, please contact us at \\nadmissions@haashall.org\\n.\\nI applied in the past. Do I need to re-apply?\\nYou must re-apply for your scholar to be considered for the lottery each year that your applicant is interested in attending.\\xa0If you applied for admission in the past and were not admitted, you must re-apply.\\nHaas Hall Academy is an accelerated, rigorous math and science based college-preparatory open-enrollment charter school serving grades 7-12 for scholars with high intensity of purpose. Haas Hall Academy has been recognized by U.S. News and World Report as one of the finest high schools in the nation!\\nWe would like to thank you for considering Haas Hall Academy as the next step in your child’s academic career by joining the exceptional group of individuals who have made the important decision to focus on preparation for college.\\nHaas Hall Academy does not discriminate on the basis of sex, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, academic or athletic eligibility.

I am always getting pushed and encouraged by teachers, classmates, and my parents to strive to be my best. If I don’t get an A, I know I have back up at Haas Hall. It is a place where I learn a lot from everyone around me.\\nAlso, Haas Hall is a small community, so pretty much everybody knows everybody. It has a friendly atmosphere. Eighth graders are friends with seniors. Students know teachers that they may not have for a class, and it is very much a small-town atmosphere. Everybody is included and has a group to fit into.\\nNicole, graduated 2014\\n“After making the switch (to Haas Hall) I no longer dreaded the next school day. Instead, I was curious and interested to see what school may offer me each day. I threw myself into all kinds of activities and really found my niche. I finally felt like school mattered.”\\nRead More\\nMaddy, graduated 2014\\n“The atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper. Acheivement in academics is always encouraged and rewarded, not just by the school, but by the competitive nature of the student body.”\\nRead More\\nGanesh,\\xa0sophomore\\n“When I came to this school, it was the smallest school I had ever been to, and I thought to myself, ‘How can this be the best school in Arkansas?’\\xa0I came to Haas and I found out how hard I really have to work to get into a good college and be successful in life.”\\nRead More\\nShare this:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nGoogle\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nCopyright © by The Academy, Inc., All rights reserved.  \\nHaas Hall Academy\\n   |   \\nSchools\\n   |   \\nContact Us\\n   |   \\nNewsletter\\n   |   \\nPrivacy Policy\\n   |   \\nTerms & Conditions\\n No part of this publication may be sold, copied, distributed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or   by any means, mechanical or digital, including photocopying and recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the author.\\nSend to Email Address\\nYour Name\\nYour Email Address\\nCancel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

It is a small but friendly community of people who love to learn and to teach. Haas offers a variety of classes to take, so anybody can have the perfect educational experience. With the personalized scheduling at Haas, I was able to take Chemistry and Algebra 2 in my eighth-grade year, which I would be difficult to do anywhere else.\\nHaas Hall Academy also has a large selection of clubs and other extracurricular activities. Here, anybody can find something they will enjoy. I run cross-country and compete in Quiz Bowl. These activities not only give me things to do after school, but also help me meet new people and make new friends. All in all, Haas Hall is a great school for anyone who loves to learn.\\nMaddy, graduated 2014\\n“The atmosphere at Haas Hall is one that encourages success – my classmates have continually challenged me to work harder and think deeper.

Unfortunately, charter schools in Arkansas receive the state minimum per child, but do not receive any additional monies from local millages. The Annual Fund closes the gap in public school funding inequalities and ensures our academic offerings provide the experiences and challenges necessary to ready our students\\xa0for the academic challenges that await them in their higher education pursuits.\\nParents, alumni, faculty, grandparents, and friends of the school are encouraged to contribute to the Annual Fund. The 2016-2017 Annual Fund goal is $200,000. Please consider making a donation this year to help us reach that goal.\\nVisionary\\n$15,000 and up\\nPrincipal\\n$1,000 - $2,499\\nValedictorian\\n$10,000 - $14,999\\nAdvocate\\n$500 - $999\\nTop of the Class\\n$5,000 - $9,999\\nPartner\\n$100 - $499\\nDean's List\\n$2,500 - $4,999\\nFriend\\nUp to $99\\n The Annual Fund goal is $200,000.\\nEvery gift, of every size, makes an impact.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMAKE A GIFT\\nWHY IS MY PARTICIPATION IMPORTANT?\\nHaas Hall Academy is a young institution, established in 2004. With a small constituency,\\xa0particularly when compared to other traditional public schools, gifts of any size have an even greater impact on the school and are\\xa0crucial to our future external funding endeavors.\\xa0Participation in the \\nAnnual Fund\\n\\xa0is as important as the actual value of the gift.\\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I GIVE?\\nGiven the importance of the Annual Fund to the quality and excellence of Haas Hall Academy, we ask that you give as generously as you can. The school community is extremely grateful to everyone who contributes, as each gift is critical to the success of the Annual Fund. Pledge and receive recognition as part of\\xa0The Charter Society, which recognizes donors at various levels.\\nYour gift will allow us to provide the finest education for all our students. In addition, our eligibility for grants and matching funds is based, in part, on the level of donor participation of our community.\\nIS MY GIFT TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?\\nAll donations to the Haas Hall Academy Foundation are fully tax-deductible provided you do not receive any goods or services in return. Receipts are issued for all gifts. The Haas Hall Academy Fund accepts gifts of cash, credit or debit cards, stocks, or securities and bequests.\\nIt is helpful to know that in a highly appreciated market, a charitable stock gift can offer additional tax advantages.\\nCAN I PLEDGE NOW AND PAY LATER?\\nThe school’s fiscal year runs from July 1st to June 30th. Pledges can be paid at any time and may be paid in installments.\\nHOW DO I MAKE MY GIFT?\\nMake a Donation\\nMake a Donation\\nYour tax-deductible donation\\xa0provides the flexibility to meet the needs of over 1,000 scholars.\\n MAKE A GIFT\\nThank you to the Families & Friends of Haas Hall Academy who have gotten our Annual Fund Campaign off to an excellent start!\\nVisionary\\nAnonymous\\nBillie Jo Starr\\nWalmart Foundation\\nWalton Family Foundation\\nAdd your name to this list. \\nMake a Gift\\n today!\\nValedictorian\\nRenee & J.P.

Tim explains, “We’re putting roots in the ground, we’re developing a culture – one of respect, where everyone matters. Together we’re striving to achieve as a team. Many people are starting to call it “The Biome Way”.” Tim Houghton became involved with The Biome before the school even opened. Knowing Tim’s rich background and passion for STEAM, board chair, Jim O’Donnell asked Tim to join the school board.\\nThroughout the last 3 years, Tim has witnessed the immense effort that it takes to open a school. In his role as a board member, he is heavily involved in the administrative and financial functions of The Biome. Removed from the day to day, Tim missed having the opportunity to witness the daily growth taking place each day in the classroom. This desire spurred Tim to begin tutoring third-grade learners every week after school. These lucky third graders look forward to their weekly one-on-one time with Mr. Houghton – who somehow always has a lunch box full of treats to accompany their afternoon of math practice.\\nFor Tim, making an impact can take place at any level – from his role on the board to the impact he can make in the lives of just a few of our third-grade learners. Tim shared, “I’m continually impressed by the students. They’re very observant. They are really quick to size you up. They’re constantly watching and learning. This has shown me that my words really matter and I want to be a good role model for them.”\\nThis isn’t the first time that Tim has offered his time to help young people learn and grow. Throughout his life, Tim has valued the opportunity to mentor young people. Years ago, he began mentoring two young boys all the way from fifth grade to their college graduation. Now, he calls these young men and their families his friends. He hopes he is beginning this journey once again with the third-grade learners he is tutoring.\\nPrior to becoming involved with The Biome, Tim did not have a deep knowledge about charter schools. Today, Tim firmly believes charter schools are vital in the city. He shared, “Charter schools are important because they give parents choice.” Further, Tim emphasized that charters have greater flexibility to meet the needs of their students and he is seeing this take place at The Biome. Every day, everyone is working together to ensure the success of every student.\\nIt is individuals like Tim who help our school community grow stronger. Every day, our school community grows when an\\xa0individual says yes I want to be an active part of helping to build our next generation. For Tim, every time he comes to The Biome, he is inspired, because he sees classrooms full of our future scientists and engineers. He is confident that our region’s future STEAM talent will credit The Biome as the place where they first got their start.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n03/21/2018\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

       "  'Monthly Archives: December 2014\\nSchool can be More!\\nLeave a reply\\nI am the Founding President & CEO of The Biome, but more than that, I am a former student of an academic program that, by virtue of its design, stood no chance of meeting my needs as a learner. My journey to lead Youth Learning Center’s efforts to open The Biome did not start 11 years ago at the organization’s founding. My genesis began a few decades prior, in a local public school in St. Louis, Missouri.\\nFor dramatic effect, let’s imagine that my fourth-grade learner profile was as follows:\\nBill is a fourth-grade student who has special interests and abilities (every child’s profile should begin with this opening line). He seems to enjoy learning through hands-on activities and has a particular interest in computer science, experiments, insects, and writing. Bill also appears to be interested in fishing and history!\\nDuring my fourth-grade year, I was appointed to the project team tasked with building an enormous paper mache replica of Valley Forge. This assignment represented a perfect fit for a student with my profile. We were excused from our regular reading period to take in the project that would be displayed during a school assembly. Our supplies consisted of an enormous cardboard base, plenty of flour, water, newspaper, and paint.\\nIt would have been great if my selection were guided by a careful examination of my interest and needs as a learner. I suspect that my appointment to the project team was a result of my designation as one of the “smart kids” in the building. I would like to recount numerous appointments to projects during my elementary years but sadly, I cannot.\\nI can, however, recount numerous learning opportunities that were missed as I sat quietly in my seat and received a reward for compliance.\\nI believe that school can be more than textbooks, assigned seating, and lectures. School should be a ‘living lab’ where best practices and innovation converge to meet the needs of students. Launching The Biome provides me with an opportunity to create the educational ecosystem that was unavailable to me and hundreds of my peers. Every child has unique gifts and talents. Our (parents, educators and community) goal is to help children identify their uniqueness and provide authentic and enriching experiences designed to aid their growth as learners.\\nAccording to a 2014 Washington Post article, in 2012, the U.S. high school graduation rate peaked at 80 percent. Nationally, Blacks and Hispanics graduated at rates of 69 percent and 73 percent respectively.[1] These statistics do not address the disparity in achievement standards and college or career readiness, but we will save that discussion for a future post. At best, a 20 percent national dropout rate is alarming. The percentage dropout rate represents approximately 718,000 children.1 Continuing with our current model of education makes sense if the goal is to achieve relatively modest results. Opting for radical changes in educational outcomes requires that we embrace radical changes in our educational model. Through the adoption or creation of innovative policy and practice, we can turn our nation’s academic fortunes.\\nAt The Biome, we are committed to sound practice, innovation and measuring the results of our children’s performance and our academic model. The Biome represents another step in a growing belief that schools can and should be designed for all of our children.\\nBy the way, we were not allowed to finish the paper mache project.\\n[1] Layton, L. (2014, April 28). National high school graduation rates at historic high, but disparities still exist.

       "  'ed by \\nGalicia Guerrero | \\nMay 30, 2018\\nThe Biome Grows Readers\\nThere remains a dire need to help students improve literacy skills and guide them on a pathway to success. We know that children who do not read proficiently by the end of third grade are four times more likely to leave school without a diploma than proficient readers.\\nIt is crucial that children master grade-level reading by 3rd grade because that is when instruction moves from a focus on learning to read to reading to learn. Basic reading skills become vital for continued learning in other subjects, like math and science. Without these foundational skills, students are unable to keep up with their peers and continue to fall farther and farther behind. (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2010, 2017) Worse yet, the ability to overcome literacy challenges only increases overtime – 85% of all juveniles who come in contact with the juvenile court system are functionally illiterate.\\nAt The Biome, we recognize early intervention is critical in supporting students. We refuse to let students fall behind. To combat these statistics, we believe in providing all students with reading intervention and many other specialized services – all at no cost to our families.\\xa0\\nSynia, a highly motivated, creative, and fun-loving second grader is an incredible example of the impact of this type of support. Synia loves reading fairytale stories, practicing multiplication, and creating new games on the playground with her friends. When she entered 2nd\\xa0grade, she was identified as below grade level in reading. Rather than avoiding this challenge, Synia eagerly looked forward to building her skills during reading intervention with Ms. Cortner, our reading specialist. Weekly they would work together on both reading and writing. Ms. Cortner expressed, “Synia really identifies as a reader and a writer and this is huge! She will say, ‘as I reader I know I can use a strategy like chunking to help me.’ Each time she finished a book you could see her confidence grow.”\\nToday,\\xa0Synia\\xa0can proudly show each and every reading strategy she uses to conquer one book after another.\\xa0This past April, Synia graduated from individualized reading intervention, moved up nine levels in reading, and is now on\\xa0level\\xa0for second grade.\\xa0\\nIn order to continue to provide this extraordinary level of support for our students, we must meet our fiscal year fundraising goal. Next year, we will hit our next major milestone – opening fourth grade. Your support will allow us to continue to expand and grow The Biome School Community.\\nYour contribution will help our current students lay the groundwork for their future success and strengthen our community.

       "  'licia Guerrero | \\nMay 30, 2018\\nLearning Beyond Our School Walls\\nAt The Biome, we are striving to expand our learning ecosystem beyond our classrooms and into the community. We believe learning takes place everywhere. In St. Louis, we are fortunate to have incredible community assets such as a world-class zoo. Partnering with the Saint Louis Zoo, we’ve created an immersive, experiential learning experience for our second grade learners.\\nA core aspect of The Biome School curriculum is the incorporation of Big Question units. These units encourage learners to ask and answer real world questions. Projects are then designed based on the project based learning model or PBL. In PBL, students work on a project over an extended period of time (from a week up to a semester) that engages them in solving a real-world problem or answering a complex question. They demonstrate their knowledge and skills by developing a public product or presentation for a real audience. Research has shown that students learning through PBL retain content longer and have a deeper understanding of what they are learning (BIE, 2013).\\n“When we think about experiential learning at The Biome School, it isn’t about doing projects there at the school. We want our kids out in the community; it needs to be real world. We want them to experience the city of St. Louis – but, also, develop relationships with other adults in the community,” explains Bill Kent, President & CEO of The Biome.\\nThis year, for the second grade zoo school experience, learners took on the challenge of researching the activity levels of different animals at the Zoo. To prepare for the onsite research experience, learners began brainstorming questions, creating preliminary maps, and gaining exposure to animals as St. Louis Zookeepers brought in a variety of animals such as snakes, turtles, and birds into the classroom.\\nFrom February 26 through March 5, our learners packed up their backpacks, grabbed their iPads, and we’re ready to hit the zoo. Using the iPad tool, Observe to Learn, learners took to observing animals, collecting data, and creating ethograms. Further, throughout the week, learners had the opportunity to make the Zoo their own. Daily, they interacted with the Zoo staff, created maps, measured distances, fed animals, practiced wayfinding, and worked together to solve problems.\\nLearning did not end once our learners were back in their classrooms at The Biome. Learners discovered the hard work of documenting their scientific work. Together, they created animal poems, developed a large-scale visual map, and reported their work through the scientific method documenting their question, hypotheses, procedures, and results.\\nSo what did our learners think of their experience at the Zoo? They felt like true researchers! Tayonna, 2nd grade learner expressed, “I loved investigating the animals. It was exciting to go every single day and learn in new places.”\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

The goal was to engage area educators and business professionals in a discussion on a topic that is gaining momentum, the STEM pipeline gap. The main concern is that within the progression from primary education to college, we are missing opportunities to ignite and foster interest and engagement among students in STEM subjects and ultimately STEM careers.\\nThe STEM Pipeline panelists included: Dr. Victoria Brown-Kennerly, Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Webster University; Dr. Dinesh Mirchandani, Department Chair of Management and Information Systems, UMSL; Dr. Robyn Wiens, Principal at Hawthorn Leadership School for Girls; and Bill Kent Jr., Founding President and CEO, The Biome School.\\nNumbers tell the story. The U.S. currently has a deficit of half a million IT professional for jobs that are currently open. As IT integrates into all aspects of business and life, this gap will continue to increase. In addition, 70 million people are retiring in the next decade with only 30 million replacing them. There is no question that the rise of STEM jobs and the lack of qualified applicants to fill these jobs is a growing concern.\\nThe question remains how are we going to inspire students to pursue STEM careers to fill this pipeline?\\nPanelists cited a number of cracks in the pipeline that often hinder students from entering STEM careers. These range from a lack of opportunities to develop interests in STEM subjects to a lack of STEM subject teachers and mentors to help them visualize themselves in STEM careers. As a result, there are too many missed opportunities between educators and STEM companies to collaborate and create meaningful learning experiences.\\nOn a positive note, panelists agreed that there are\\xa0a\\xa0number of ways to create a better pipeline. For example, a 2016 report by the American Educational Research Association revealed that as early as Kindergarten, there is evidence of gender gaps in math achievement.\\nThat’s why at The Biome, we work hard to engage students early and often and enable them to build a strong foundation. As Bill Kent explained, “At The Biome, we literally extend our classrooms beyond our own walls and into the community.”\\nThe Biome’s vision comes to fruition through our experiential off-site micro schools, which utilize existing community assets, like the Saint Louis Zoo, to support authentic learning experiences for all our students. Through our micro schools, students delve deep into topics of interest and learn from experts in the field.\\n“It is our responsibility to increase our student’s readiness to step into the pipeline. We want to collaborate with experts in STEM fields. We are open, tell us how we need to be ready to partner with you.” Bill emphasized.\\nThe Saint Louis Chapter Society of Information (SIM) brings together IT leaders to share, network, and give back to their communities through the collaboration of local chapters.

A passionate and energetic teacher, her skills include curriculum development, classroom management, lesson planning and development and technology.\\nKristin’s educational focus is based on implementing instructional strategies that actively engage students in meaningful learning experiences to ensure development to their fullest potential. Her goal this year is to instill a love of learning in the minds and hearts of her lively and enthusiastic class of five- and six-year-olds and to have every kindergartner reading and doing math at first grade level by the end of the school year.\\nHer approach to teaching reading is to encourage students to get involved in the story. For example, after reading a book to the children, she challenges them to retell the story in their own words and discuss their feelings, opinions, and attitudes about the conclusion.\\nShe selects children’s stories that have significance. Recent books include Sweet Briar Goes to School about a skunk who is initially rejected by other students for being different but who ultimately uses his own natural resources to save the day; Leola and the Honeybears, an African-American retelling of the classic adventure story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears; and Chicken Little, which teaches kids to have courage and make decisions logically without overreacting.\\nKristin has a strong background in early childhood education. Prior to coming to The Biome school, Kristin was an early childhood assistant with the Parkway School District and before that she was a Lead Kindergarten teacher for two years with KIPP Victory Academy.\\nThe Biome is her first experience with a STEAM school. She believes that The Biome’s commitment to science, technology, engineering, art, and math is an important advantage for all students in every grade because it helps children to understand, appreciate and apply what they learn to a world that is so interconnected.\\nKristin earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and\\xa0Accounting from Missouri Baptist University.\\xa0After working in the business world she returned to Missouri Baptist University to obtain\\xa0a Post-Baccalaureate degree with certification in Early Childhood Education.\\nWhen she’s not at school or preparing lesson plans, Kristin enjoys working out and spending time with Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. But her real passion is baking, especially cupcakes and cheesecake, claiming that her cheesecake rivals the Cheesecake Factory’s best.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n08/31/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJean Turney – A World-Class Teacher\\nLeave a reply\\nJean Turney, second-grade teacher at The Biome School, brings a world of experience to her students, literally. Over the course of her professional career, she has worked in a variety of settings within the United States including the suburbs of Potomac, Maryland, the hill country of West Virginia, and south St. Louis, as well as two summers facilitating community development and leadership trainings in Uganda and three years as a Jesuit Volunteer in Belize, Central America.\\nAs an educator, Jean has structured, facilitated and assessed innovative, experiential daily classroom learning for over 20 years across disciplines and grade levels spanning elementary through high school. Through all of her experiences, one consistent element has been to integrate meaningful community service with instruction and reflection. She firmly believes the impact is significant not only for the learner but also for the community because authentic, relevant, engaged service can guide people toward a deeper consciousness of how social justice can promote the common good.\\nJean is excited about being part of the Biome School because of the spirit of compassion that exists here. She not only believes in the mission of the Biome, she believes that the energy and commitment of her fellow teachers and administrators will equip every student with the tools and skills to face the challenges ahead of them with intelligence and courage.\\nIn her second grade classroom, Jean is committed to creating a place where her students know they BELONG. A place where they are safe, have some power and can make mistakes and not risk their dignity. She wants them to know they are capable of learning and growing. She wants to enable them to experience that excitement about learning in this classroom, as well as in the community. And she wants them to know that she has high expectations and will never give up on them.\\nOne example of a recent classroom project was teaching students about the August 21st eclipse. Learning included integrating science, math, and literature. Students learned about shadows, did experiments, and read the book Bear Shadow by Frank Asch and poems by Shel Silverstein. Resources from Bill Nye, NASA website, and the school library were also utilized.\\nDuring the event, students documented their observations, wrote sentence strips about their observations, and later organized, edited and revised their writing. The lesson plan allowed students to move through the process at their own pace. While some finished right away and moved on to the next project, others required more time.\\nJean believes that giving students the time they need to complete a project can help develop their persistence and enable them to have the opportunity of experiences the sense of completion and the pride in their accomplishment. According to Jean, one’s sense of self-esteem is strengthened by genuine accomplishment, not empty praise. She brings this philosophy to life every day in her classroom.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n08/31/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRetirement was short lived for Dr. Pamela Retzlaff. Just a year into being retired, she was doing some consulting work when she ran into a Biome School board member who told her about the school, its mission and an opportunity for a new principal. A short time later, Dr. Retzlaff drove by the school to check it out and her retirement was history.\\nAs she learned more, Dr. Retzlaff was convinced that The Biome School was a place where students, teachers, parents, administrators, and others could come together and have a positive impact on a quality education. Today she knows her instincts were correct.\\nDr. Retzlaff joined the Biome School as principal at the end of January 2017, bringing with her 36 years of experience in private and public schools, including 18 years with the Webster Groves School District and seven years with Kirkwood School District. One of the things she observed from her first interview was the close relationship that existed between everyone involved with the school.\\nAs principal, Dr. Retzlaff is the instructional leader for the school and responsible for providing whatever is necessary to enable children to learn. In reality, this means she not only makes sure that children have access to the right educational resources for learning and teachers have the best opportunities for professional development, she also makes sure that the school building is clean and well-maintained and that there is ongoing and open communications with parents, the school community and other stakeholders.\\nTrue to the school’s mission of creating out of classroom learning experiences for students, Dr. Retzlaff has arranged a variety of opportunities for students. Examples include regular visits to the nearby branch of St. Louis Public Library, field trips to the Link Auditorium in the CWE to listen to storyteller extraordinaire, Bobby Norfolk, and an on-site study program in collaboration with the St. Louis Zoo, as well as in-school visits by the Opera Theatre of St. Louis and other organizations.\\nAs Dr. Retzlaff explains, there isn’t anything she won’t do for the school, whether it’s helping to setup and supervise lunch time or calling a meeting with staff to discuss how to minimize the amount of mud on the shoes of children that comes into the building from the playground, requiring a disproportionate amount of time and energy to clean up. She also has initiated literacy mornings for parents to spend a half-hour reading to their children before school and parent workshops to support children’s learning.\\nShe particularly enjoys being around the children. Just recently, she had an impromptu discussion with a group of first graders that focused on how her earrings, necklace, and hairstyle reminded the students of their grandmothers. Dr. Retzlaff turned the discussion into a teachable moment by explaining how people of similar ages often seem to dress the same and like the same kinds of music, regardless of where they live or what kind of work they do.\\nWith a background in the arts, Dr. Retzlaff’s educational philosophy is aligned with the school’s STEAM curriculum in terms of believing in a team approach to problem-solving. In addition to earning a Doctor of Educational Administration degree from St. Louis University and Master of Science in Education, degree in Supervision and Administration from Bank Street College, Parsons School of Design in New York, NY, she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Art with a minor in Education from Cardinal Stritch University, Fox Point, WI. She is certified by the state of Missouri as a superintendent, principal for K-8, and art educator.\\nIn her spare time, Dr. Retzlaff hardly takes it easy. Instead, she enjoys being a spinning instructor at the Kirkwood and Brentwood YMCA and Webster Groves Recreation Center, as well as lifting weights and being a Les Mills BodyPump™ coach. She also has a passion for gardening and spending time with her grandchildren.\\nWhile there are many reasons why Dr. Retzlaff is thrilled to be principal of the Biome School, one of the things she enjoys the most is being part of a close-knit family of students, teachers, staff and administrators. Compared to the large public school districts she came from, the small, intimate Biome School community is a refreshing change of pace where everyone cares about one another and everyone is focused on the same dream and vision for every student in the school.\\nDr. Retzlaff – Principal with a Purpose\\n08/31/2017\\nLeave a reply\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

       "  \"endar \\nWhat's New\\nPosted by \\nGalicia Guerrero | \\nApril 2, 2018\\nMaking Reading a Priority in St. Louis\\nThere is no doubt that literacy plays a powerful role in every facet of early education, which is why here at The Biome we cultivate an atmosphere where our learners grow to be readers. Without a strong foundation in literacy, a strong STEAM education is not possible. Therefore, teachers and staff at The Biome focus much of their efforts on making reading a fun, enjoyable skill for each and every one of our children. Cultivating a love of reading is especially crucial in early elementary education. If we can instill the value of reading into our learners, their future opportunities will be boundless.\\nOn Friday, March 2, The Biome celebrated Read Across America Day by taking a school-wide field trip to the St. Louis Public Library’s Central Library. During this off-campus excursion, they participated in the nation’s very first Read Aloud Flash Mob with the students at Lafayette Preparatory Academy. What makes your average ordinary field trip to the library a flash mob? When cued, different grades began reading \\nGreen Eggs and Ham\\n. During this symphony reading of Dr. Seuss’ famous children’s book, individuals involved with The Biome School held signs displaying different facts about literacy, such as “Literacy begins at home.” The result was a fun and playful chorus of Dr. Seuss rhythm and rhyme. At the end of the day, learners were given their own copies of the book, as well as a library card to further enhance their developing interest in reading.\\nIn Missouri, only 36% of students are proficient in reading (NAEP, 2015). The Literacy Flash Mob not only encouraged our learners here at The Biome to find enjoyment inside the covers of a book but also advocated for the importance of literacy in early childhood.\\nThe effort behind building a strong foundation in literacy is continuously making an impact at The Biome. Recent STAR Reading scores, a research-validated, state-specific assessment, evidenced The Biome’s dedication to improving literacy for every learner. Each grade level, from Kindergarten to third grade, made remarkable improvements in reading. For example, 92% Kindergarteners showed improvement in reading levels, increasing an average of 1.7 levels since the beginning of the school year. Further, 82% first graders having shown improvement in reading levels, 97% second graders, and 100% third graders.\\nThese accomplishments are extremely exciting for all of us here at The Biome to see, but of course, none of this would be made possible without our families who are dedicated to their children’s education.

Recognizing that so many of the boys he grew up with did not have the family support he enjoyed and that many of those boys ended up in prison, Mr. Kent was moved to leave his business career and dedicate his professional life to improving academic and life outcomes of youth from under-resourced backgrounds.\\xa0 He applied his background in business management to directing the original YLC building project in 2010 and the 2015 renovation. He has also overseen the development of programming from an all-volunteer organization to the current organization providing STEAM education through outreach programs and eventually the founding of The Biome School in 2015.\\xa0 The Biome School is a new kind of K-8 school for the next generation – one that offers customized, project based and student-centered learning opportunities with an emphasis on growth mindset and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) education. The Biome charter school creates a balanced learning ecosystem in which teachers work together with students to cultivate a growth mindset as they discover their unique gifts, talents and interests. Mr. Kent earned his Bachelor of Science from Lindenwood University and joined Youth Learning Center after serving as a manager and career insurance underwriter with Reliable Insurance Company for 13 years.\\nWhat was your vision for creating The Biome?\\nMy vision was to create a school that would primarily be responsive to the academic needs of children and secondarily, contribute to emerging and innovative educational practices and our understanding of the way in which we learn. \\xa0Additionally, my goal was to create a school, that exudes a welcoming, diverse, and nurturing environment.\\nWhy are you excited to work for The Biome?\\nThe Biome opens an entirely new world to our staff. The relationships that we are building with like-minded educators, community members, parents, and students are incredibly valuable. \\xa0The Biome’s opening has made many of these relationships possible.\\nWhat is your top bucket list item?\\nMy top bucket list item is to visit Israel.\\nWhat are you most proud of in your professional life?\\nI’m most proud of my work with YLC and now The Biome. We are creating a unique organization that will help many children and educators cultivate a love for learning.\\nHow do you want to be remembered?\\nI would like to be remembered as a man who kept commitments to his family and his faith. It’s really important to stand for the things that are right, even when it requires\\xa0sacrifice. \\xa0Life is not about the things that you want, but rather, about your impact on others; that’s true legacy.\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nDr. Pamela Retzlaff\\nPrincipal\\nDr. Pamela Retzlaff\\nPrincipal\\nDr. Pamela Retzlaff has been an educator for 36 years, working in private and public schools and as an adjunct university instructor.

       "  \"ndar \\nWhat's New\\nPosted by \\nGalicia Guerrero | \\nMarch 21, 2018\\nSolving One Math Problem at a Time\\nMaking a Difference By Solving One Math Problem at a Time\\nEach year, Tim Houghton, Biome School Board Member, continues to be inspired by The Biome and how it has continued to evolve. Tim explains, “We’re putting roots in the ground, we’re developing a culture – one of respect, where everyone matters. Together we’re striving to achieve as a team. Many people are starting to call it “The Biome Way”.” Tim Houghton became involved with The Biome before the school even opened. Knowing Tim’s rich background and passion for STEAM, board chair, Jim O’Donnell asked Tim to join the school board.\\nThroughout the last 3 years, Tim has witnessed the immense effort that it takes to open a school. In his role as a board member, he is heavily involved in the administrative and financial functions of The Biome. Removed from the day to day, Tim missed having the opportunity to witness the daily growth taking place each day in the classroom. This desire spurred Tim to begin tutoring third-grade learners every week after school. These lucky third graders look forward to their weekly one-on-one time with Mr. Houghton – who somehow always has a lunch box full of treats to accompany their afternoon of math practice.\\nFor Tim, making an impact can take place at any level – from his role on the board to the impact he can make in the lives of just a few of our third-grade learners. Tim shared, “I’m continually impressed by the students. They’re very observant. They are really quick to size you up. They’re constantly watching and learning. This has shown me that my words really matter and I want to be a good role model for them.”\\nThis isn’t the first time that Tim has offered his time to help young people learn and grow. Throughout his life, Tim has valued the opportunity to mentor young people. Years ago, he began mentoring two young boys all the way from fifth grade to their college graduation. Now, he calls these young men and their families his friends. He hopes he is beginning this journey once again with the third-grade learners he is tutoring.\\nPrior to becoming involved with The Biome, Tim did not have a deep knowledge about charter schools. Today, Tim firmly believes charter schools are vital in the city. He shared, “Charter schools are important because they give parents choice.” Further, Tim emphasized that charters have greater flexibility to meet the needs of their students and he is seeing this take place at The Biome. Every day, everyone is working together to ensure the success of every student.\\nIt is individuals like Tim who help our school community grow stronger. Every day, our school community grows when an\\xa0individual says yes I want to be an active part of helping to build our next generation. For Tim, every time he comes to The Biome, he is inspired, because he sees classrooms full of our future scientists and engineers. He is confident that our region’s future STEAM talent will credit The Biome as the place where they first got their start.\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

The article featured The Biome’s academic model\\xa0and explains how we are providing K-3 students with a rigorous, experiential, and holistic education.\\nRead the story today by downloading a copy of the story below.\\nThe St. Louis American Features The Biome\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n12/05/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEmbracing a Team Approach for Special Education & Student Support Services\\nLeave a reply\\nBefore students can learn, they must be ready to learn. The reality is that students come to school at different levels and learn in different ways, and it takes support from multiple sources for all students to be able and ready to learn.\\nAt The Biome, we believe in working as a team to support our learners. This allows us to take a holistic approach to understanding what a student needs to be successful. Unique to The Biome is our ability to reach and respond to students quickly and consistently. In many schools the process of accessing services can take up to 90 days. However, due to the many in-school services available and strong external partnerships at The Biome, a referral is often is turned around in as quickly as 30 days. This quick turn-around is critical. Often, without these services, students struggle and are not able and ready to learn successfully in their classroom.\\nAt The Biome, in-school services include speech-language services, special education services, and reading intervention. We also partner with a number of community agencies in order to provided additional needed services such as Miriam which provides occupational therapy, CHADS which provides mentoring and counseling groups, BLASH Associates who provide individual counseling, Healthy Kids Express who provide dental, vision, and hearing screening, UMSL Community Psychological Services who provide assessments, and the Department of Health who provides a nurse in any case of an outbreak of communicable diseases.\\nWhile not every learner needs every service, when learners have access to all of these services their ability to learn grows exponentially. For example, in just the past four months, a student who was struggling to learn in the classroom and would likely be on the edge of suspension now benefits from many of our student support services, they no longer are referred for misbehaviors, and they are learning successfully in the classroom. At The Biome, as a team, we are able to quickly assess a child’s needs and open access to any service that we provide.\\nOur team approach promotes communication and builds trust. Together, in collaboration with parents, the classroom leader, and the learner, we are able to build a plan that best supports the learner. In as early as second grade, learners are invited to their own team meeting. This inclusion typically does not occur until middle or high school in most schools. However, we want learners to be able to have a voice and be able to understand what is going to happen for them.\\nAt The Biome, we know it takes a team. All members of our community are needed to help our students be successful.

To support this development, the Biome surrounds our learners with support and views all children from a holistic perspective.\\nAn important component of holistic learning is the intentional integration of opportunities for social-emotional learning. Social-emotional learning (SEL) is the process through which children learn to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. Ms. Turney, second-grade classroom leader, emphasizes, “SEL is pre-learning. If students aren’t given the opportunity to practice and develop these skills daily, it barricades their learning.”\\nSocial-emotional development is not only important for building a healthy classroom community now, but the impact is far-reaching. Up to 18 years later, students exposed to SEL in school continue to do better than their peers on a number of indicators: positive social behaviors and attitudes, skills such as empathy and teamwork, and academics. SEL participants also demonstrated a 6% increase in high school graduation rates, and an 11% increase in college graduation rates (CASEL, 2017).\\nAt The Biome: Everyone Matters \\nAt The Biome, every member of our community is valued. Each day, learners gather for a morning meeting where they listen and share with one another what is happening in their lives. In Ms. Sullivan’s first grade classroom, learners rate themselves on a scale of 1-5 of how they’re feeling and why. As the school year has progressed, she has seen her learners begin to recognize different faces and body language and understand how those relate to how someone is feeling. Her learners are quickly developing their listening skills and are making stronger connections to one another. These relationships help learners to support one another in the classroom. It isn’t uncommon to see learners stop and pull their classmates aside and remind them to take 3 big deep breaths when they are angry or upset – a skill one would assume only a teacher would employ.\\nAt The Biome: Every Voice Matters\\nChoice is powerful. As a child, many choices are made for you. However, At The Biome, every day, learners have the opportunity to make choices for themselves, for their classroom, and for what they want to learn. For example, recently in Kindergarten, Mr. D’s students were exploring “What is a Scientist?” for their Big Question Unit. As a class, they voted and decided they wanted to learn more about chemistry. In response, Mr. D. focused their class time on projects that explore different principles of chemistry. When students are heard, they know their thoughts and opinions are respected and valued. This leads to a classroom culture where trust is felt, learners feel comfortable taking risks, and they are further motivated to solve problems, rather than to simply give up after the first try.\\nAt The Biome: Everyone’s Contributions Matter\\nTeamwork is central to how we learn and grow at The Biome. If we don’t respect one another, we can’t work well with one another. In Ms. Turney’s second grade classroom, problem-solving skills are built on multiple levels. Learners are given real problem-solving scenarios daily just from the maintenance of their classroom – from determining how to keep books organized to deciding how to best remember everyone’s birthday. Projects and group activities teach learners how to break down tasks, take on different team member roles, and learn how to provide each other with constructive feedback. In Ms. Turney’s class, learners also have the opportunity to bring their problems to group meetings where they can get assistance and are able to make a choice on how they will solve a problem individually or together as a whole class.\\nAt The Biome, you can feel the commitment there is to build a strong school community – from classroom leaders to parents, everyone is striving to make a contribution. We invite you to consider what contribution you can make to The Biome School Community:\\nAs 2017 comes to a close, we invite you to support our 2017 Year End Appeal, where your contribution will directly support our holistic learning environment at The Biome by providing needed student support materials and services such as:\\nPATHS Social-Emotional Learning Curriculum – $250 per classroom\\nOccupational Therapy Services – $500 per month\\nLiteracy Benchmark and Assessment Tools – $1,000 per grade level \\nStudent Mental Health Counseling Sessions – $2,500 for an academic year\\nClassroom Libraries – $5,000 per classroom\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n12/05/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

The second best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb \\nThe time to plant a seed is now. Slalom sees the importance of planting seeds in their community early and often. We continue to hear research highlighting the growing gap of STEM talent. We see the number of unfilled positions continue to grow year after year. \\nIn 2010, just 5.4 STEM jobs were posted online for every one unemployed STEM worker. \\nIn 2016, STEM employers faced a dire picture: 13 STEM jobs were posted online for each unemployed worker—or roughly 3 million more jobs than the number of available, trained professionals who could potentially fill them (New American Economy Research Fund, 2016). \\nDavid Harrow, Community Engagement Lead at Slalom, emphasized we need to start investing at the elementary school level, “The [STEM] gap is so large that we can’t just focus on the next 3-5 years. Rather, we need to focus on the next 10-15 years. Not doing so would be short-sighted.”\\nFrom the first time Slalom visited The BiOME, they saw a different approach: every student was engaged. David enthusiastically explained that “The students weren’t just learning math, but they were learning a project-based approach. It allowed every student learn in their own way.” For many who tour The BiOME, it is this rigorous, hands-on approach that they find refreshing. Many are inspired to see just how willing and excited students are to learn. Stefanie Thelen, General Manager of Slalom St. Louis, was so inspired by the BiOME school and its ability to engage, build curiosity and critical thinking skills, she has directed\\xa0Slalom to be a BiOME school champion.\\nSince the beginning of the school year, Slalom has taken an active role and become valued members of our school community. From joining us monthly at our Literacy Mornings and reading with our learners, to supporting our annual gala as a Diamond level sponsor, to creating and leading new afterschool programs, Slalom has enthusiastically responded to every opportunity by saying, “yes, count us in!”\\nSlalom’s community engagement mission is “to help make St. Louis into a city in which every person loves their work and life.” Slalom believes the rising tide raises us all. \\xa0This mission fits seamlessly with The BiOME’s approach to education. The future of our community depends on how we prepare our children. Slalom’s support of The BiOME is centered on the belief that in order to create future STEM talent, we need to plant the seeds now.\\xa0 Educating our children is a shared responsibility between our schools, community, and businesses. We need to partner and widen our lenses as we prepare for the future.\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

From providing one-on-one tutoring to small group instruction, AmeriCorps teaching assistants embrace the Biome’s commitment to helping every learner achieve his or her potential.\\nHaving AmeriCorps members in classrooms is the result of The Biome School having been chosen last summer to receive a Federal AmeriCorps grant award for the 2017-2018 school year from the Missouri Community Service Commission. In addition to providing daily academic support for the Biome’s STEAM curriculum, AmeriCorps members also participate in PATHS programming, which helps support learner’s social-emotional skills such as self-control, self-esteem and problem-solving.\\nThe positive impact of this additional funding happens every day at The Biome School. For example, one of the AmeriCorps teaching assistants, Ivette Lozano, grew up in California in a low-income environment herself. She understands first-hand the value of early intervention for learners who may be struggling either academically or emotionally. “Just knowing that someone cares and is available to give a learner the extra time and attention he or she needs directly impacts learning success,” said Ivette. “It not only enhances a learner’s self-confidence, it can inspire them to want to achieve more.”\\nIvette works primarily with learners in kindergarten and first grade at The Biome. On a typical day, while the classroom teacher may be leading a general writing lesson, Ivette may be working separately with a small group of four learners, helping them improve their reading comprehension or understand how to put their thoughts in writing and use proper sentence structure. Another day, she may work one-on-one with a learner on how to use communication skills to better manage social interactions. “When I hear a learner apologize for accidentally bumping into a classmate, I know I’ve had an impact that may last a lifetime,” said Ivette. She added that joining AmeriCorps at The Biome has inspired her to become a kindergarten teacher\\xa0instead of an upper elementary teacher.\\nFor kindergarten teacher Kristin Williams, having an AmeriCorps member in the classroom benefits everyone. “At the beginning of the school year, I walked into a classroom of 16 very lively and enthusiastic five- and six-year-olds, including some children who had never attended a preschool and had no experience in a classroom setting. With Ivette’s help, we were able to help our young learners make a faster adjustment by giving them the one-on-one attention they need at that age,” said Kristin.\\nToday, from reading site words to doing math problems independently, every learner in Kristin’s kindergarten is making tremendous progress. “It is gratifying to see how every day our learners are becoming more independent and self-motivated,” said Kristin, who added that her goal is to have every kindergartner in her classroom reading and doing math at first-grade level by the end of the school year.\\nAlthough Kristin and Ivette did not know each other prior to the first day of school last August, they discovered that they not only have similar teaching styles, backgrounds and experiences, they are both former cheerleaders. “We have a good time coming up with cheers and chants that we use as teaching tools to make learning fun and interesting,” said Kristin. “We want the positive experience our learners have in kindergarten to inspire them to achieve success throughout their entire academic future.”\\nThe impact of the AmeriCorps grant cannot be understated. As Bill Kent, The Biome’s founder and CEO, said, “The importance of this additional funding ensures that we are able to provide the rigorous, experiential, and holistic education we are committed to providing for every learner who comes through our doors.”\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

       "  'New\\nPosted by \\nBill Kent | \\nApril 4, 2018\\nLessons from the King\\nSubmitted by:\\xa0 Willie (Bill) Kent Jr., President & CEO of The Biome School\\nIn 1970, arguably one of Flip Wilson’s most popular characters, Geraldine Jones, popularized the catchphrase, “The devil made me do it!” This catchphrase was often the character’s excuse for transgressions. Reflecting on some behaviors witnessed in today’s arenas of public debate, we have allowed our passions to lead us down a narrow and isolated path of insults, dishonesty, anger, and propaganda. This debased behavior seems evident in all areas of public discourse, including that of public education.\\nHistory often provides a void, a space calling for moral leadership, courage, and love. During the mid-1950s history created such a void and educated, passionate, and principled leaders like Dr. King and others stepped into the breach. Dr. King was not the only leader of his time to challenge America to, “Be true to what you said on paper,” however, the articulation of his message, mastery of history, and education allowed him to stand prominently and answer the call to service.\\nToday, history has created another void and is calling for those who have the moral leadership, courage, and love to pursue an equitable and fair educational system in America. The needs of our children require that we “put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander” and move towards a society in which all children, especially those from underserved communities, have the opportunity to build “Intelligence plus character.” According to Dr. King, “that is the goal of true education.”\\nIn America, and more specifically, in Missouri, we cannot realize this vision for our children through lawsuits over public funding and dishonest feuds between Charter Public Schools and Traditional Public Schools. As a community, we should join forces on the steps and in the halls of the Missouri Capitol building to demand that our children and equity in education become priorities not only in words but also in policy and funding.\\nWe all support child well-being; we all want children to succeed – no matter their zip code. Let us step into this moment of history and educate generations of children who “think logically and scientifically.” Our commitment to teaching children to protest should not outpace our calling to develop an educated and literate community. History is calling for leaders who will reignite the vestiges of “the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit” with “objective and unbiased truths.” Properly educated, our children can answer this call.\\nGeraldine’s excuse that “The devil made me do it” is no longer sufficient to explain away our bad behavior in the public square. Dr. King taught us that “If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, ‘brethren!’ Be careful, teachers!”\\nDr. King elevated his conscious and thinking to create an inclusive and loving vision for America. Let us remember that “Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” Fifty years after his assassination, we must remember the lessons that he taught us; we must not forget how he elevated his thinking and conscious.

For our 2nd\\xa0grade learners, this question leads their investigations for their current Big Question Unit. Big Questions are real-world questions that encourage learner curiosity and inquiry. Questions are explored through interdisciplinary projects guided by the passions and interests of our learners. Big Questions embrace The Biome’s rigorous, experiential, and holistic approach to learning.\\xa0\\nRigorous Academics\\nIn second grade, for over a month, learners have dug deep into discovering what grows above ground, below ground, and how things grow in our natural world. At every turn, from literacy to math to science and to art, learners were challenged to learn how things grow. During their daily literacy time, learners built their background knowledge of plants, trees, and the creatures that help plants grow. In math, leaners documented how we grow and change by practicing their measuring skills. Together they’ve gathered data on their height, arm spans, and shoe sizes. In our outdoor space, they learned to investigate and observe the parts of plants and work on their drawing and sketching skills with the assistance of Mr. Keough, who is both an artist and our Adaptive Thinking teacher.\\nExperiential Learning\\nA key aspect of project-based learning is the integration of activities that allow learners to take an active, hands-on approach to their learning. During Ms. Turney’s class’ recent visit to Bowood Farms, “What”, “Why”, and “How” came from every direction. During their visit, learners met with Susannah Eisenbraun, Biome Parent, and employee at Bowood Farms. Together, they explored the various plants and vegetables in the garden and even got to taste green beans right off the vine. Last, learners had the opportunity to gather plant observations and sketches that would ultimately influence the class mural, which displays all that grows above and below the ground.\\nHolistic Education\\nAt the Biome, learning doesn’t end when we leave the classroom. As the class started talking about growth, learners shared their predictions of how they might grow between now and May. One learner predicted that they would grow friendlier as a class. Ms. Turney’s class decided to make this a class goal and began to develop some strategies to ensure their success. The first place they decided to work on this goal was on the playground. After a dispute at recess over playground blocks, learners took the opportunity to draw and share their feelings about how they could have made changes to the situation. After a class discussion, a decision was made to take an inventory and share the blocks equally – another great real-world opportunity to practice their base ten math skills!\\nAsk our learners if the enjoy these Big Questions? Without a doubt! Second-grade learners, Miles and Grace, explained, “Big questions helps us learn about things we don’t know about in our brains yet.” In Big Question, we see that one simple question, “How do things grow?” can flourish into deeper questions and interests. Near the end of the unit, Miles and Grace excitedly shared, “My favorite part was going to Bowood farms. I love being in nature and learning about plants. I learned about how plants grow, but now I want to know why they grow where they do, and how they get their shape and color! “\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n10/02/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nThe St. Louis Mullen Foundation: Fostering a Deep Commitment to the Community\\nLeave a reply\\nAn active connection to our community lives at the heart of The Biome. Key to this connection is the long-term impact volunteers have played in the development and growth of The Biome. Ron Zalonis, a long-time volunteer to Youth Learning Center (YLC) and The Biome, clearly reflected a deep and heartfelt connection to his community.\\n\\xa0Ron’s Generosity\\nRon, a transplant to St. Louis from San Francisco, quickly found a home within the Central West End community. He was known by most as the go to expert for computer and IT help. Not only was his reputation recognized by his expertise, but also by his overwhelming generosity. Ron would not only fix everyone in the neighborhood’s computer, but he would always do it for free, refusing any kind of payment. For years, Ron volunteered at YLC, helping to set up and fix computers. In YLC’s last year of operating an after school program, Ron donated over 2 weeks of time helping to fix a dozen laptops that had been donated to the organization. Ron was proud to spend the time updating the hardware and installing software so that the departing students would have a computer to take with them to middle and high school. When YLC tried to pay Ron, he simply ripped up the check and said, “No, no this was for this kids.”\\nThe Ron Zalonis Technology Grant\\nThis past summer, Ron Zalonis passed away in his home in the Central West End. Without any close family or relatives, Ron’s many friends were left not knowing what to do. Many wanted to contribute to Ron’s funeral; however, a decision was made based on what they believed Ron would have wanted, his body was to be donated to science and donations would be collected for a charity that represented Ron’s passions and generosity. Together, the CWE neighborhood came together to host a celebration of his life on Sunday, August 27th at Rosie’s Place where over $6,720 was raised for what would formally become the Ron Zalonis Technology Grant organized by the St. Louis Mike Mullen Foundation. The Biome was proud to receive this gift on September 8, 2017. The gift will go toward fulfilling both The Biome’s and Ron’s mission of helping students to become builders of the future.\\nAbout The St. Louis Mullen Foundation \\nThe St. Louis Mullen Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that hosts the annual Mike Mullen Days. In 1999, a proclamation by St. Louis Mayor Clarence Harmon declared May 2 as Mike Mullen Day in recognition of Mike Mullen, an impactful community activist in the Central West End neighborhood. Years later, a group of his friends honored the day with a surprise party. The celebration turned into an annual tradition to raise money for Mullen’s selection of charities. Next summer will mark the 8th Annual Mike Mullen Day. The Biome is proud to be the first charity selected for the upcoming Mike Mullen Day.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n10/02/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

The second best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb \\nThe time to plant a seed is now. Slalom sees the importance of planting seeds in their community early and often. We continue to hear research highlighting the growing gap of STEM talent. We see the number of unfilled positions continue to grow year after year. \\nIn 2010, just 5.4 STEM jobs were posted online for every one unemployed STEM worker. \\nIn 2016, STEM employers faced a dire picture: 13 STEM jobs were posted online for each unemployed worker—or roughly 3 million more jobs than the number of available, trained professionals who could potentially fill them (New American Economy Research Fund, 2016). \\nDavid Harrow, Community Engagement Lead at Slalom, emphasized we need to start investing at the elementary school level, “The [STEM] gap is so large that we can’t just focus on the next 3-5 years. Rather, we need to focus on the next 10-15 years. Not doing so would be short-sighted.”\\nFrom the first time Slalom visited The BiOME, they saw a different approach: every student was engaged. David enthusiastically explained that “The students weren’t just learning math, but they were learning a project-based approach. It allowed every student learn in their own way.” For many who tour The BiOME, it is this rigorous, hands-on approach that they find refreshing. Many are inspired to see just how willing and excited students are to learn. Stefanie Thelen, General Manager of Slalom St. Louis, was so inspired by the BiOME school and its ability to engage, build curiosity and critical thinking skills, she has directed\\xa0Slalom to be a BiOME school champion.\\nSince the beginning of the school year, Slalom has taken an active role and become valued members of our school community. From joining us monthly at our Literacy Mornings and reading with our learners, to supporting our annual gala as a Diamond level sponsor, to creating and leading new afterschool programs, Slalom has enthusiastically responded to every opportunity by saying, “yes, count us in!”\\nSlalom’s community engagement mission is “to help make St. Louis into a city in which every person loves their work and life.” Slalom believes the rising tide raises us all. \\xa0This mission fits seamlessly with The BiOME’s approach to education. The future of our community depends on how we prepare our children. Slalom’s support of The BiOME is centered on the belief that in order to create future STEM talent, we need to plant the seeds now.\\xa0 Educating our children is a shared responsibility between our schools, community, and businesses. We need to partner and widen our lenses as we prepare for the future.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n04/02/2018\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMaking Reading a Priority in St. Louis\\nLeave a reply\\nThere is no doubt that literacy plays a powerful role in every facet of early education, which is why here at The Biome we cultivate an atmosphere where our learners grow to be readers. Without a strong foundation in literacy, a strong STEAM education is not possible. Therefore, teachers and staff at The Biome focus much of their efforts on making reading a fun, enjoyable skill for each and every one of our children. Cultivating a love of reading is especially crucial in early elementary education. If we can instill the value of reading into our learners, their future opportunities will be boundless.\\nOn Friday, March 2, The Biome celebrated Read Across America Day by taking a school-wide field trip to the St. Louis Public Library’s Central Library. During this off-campus excursion, they participated in the nation’s very first Read Aloud Flash Mob with the students at Lafayette Preparatory Academy. What makes your average ordinary field trip to the library a flash mob? When cued, different grades began reading \\nGreen Eggs and Ham\\n. During this symphony reading of Dr. Seuss’ famous children’s book, individuals involved with The Biome School held signs displaying different facts about literacy, such as “Literacy begins at home.” The result was a fun and playful chorus of Dr. Seuss rhythm and rhyme. At the end of the day, learners were given their own copies of the book, as well as a library card to further enhance their developing interest in reading.\\nIn Missouri, only 36% of students are proficient in reading (NAEP, 2015). The Literacy Flash Mob not only encouraged our learners here at The Biome to find enjoyment inside the covers of a book but also advocated for the importance of literacy in early childhood.\\nThe effort behind building a strong foundation in literacy is continuously making an impact at The Biome. Recent STAR Reading scores, a research-validated, state-specific assessment, evidenced The Biome’s dedication to improving literacy for every learner. Each grade level, from Kindergarten to third grade, made remarkable improvements in reading. For example, 92% Kindergarteners showed improvement in reading levels, increasing an average of 1.7 levels since the beginning of the school year. Further, 82% first graders having shown improvement in reading levels, 97% second graders, and 100% third graders.\\nThese accomplishments are extremely exciting for all of us here at The Biome to see, but of course, none of this would be made possible without our families who are dedicated to their children’s education. Not only do these scores indicate an impressive improvement in reading capabilities amongst our learners, but they also show the profound impact that a safe and creative learning environment can have on a child’s aptitude for reading.\\nTogether, we can make an impact in early literacy. Today, you can make a difference by sharing the first ever Literacy Flash Mob video with your network and raise awareness on the importance of literacy in our region.

YLC was founded as an afterschool STEAM option for public school students, based on the core belief that all students could thrive and reach their potential if given the opportunity and resources. Early on, our founders concluded that YLC would not serve children through sports/activity related programming; therefore, we concentrated on academic programs in mathematics, language arts, science, computer science, entrepreneurship, and civic leadership.\\nLaunched with an initial group of sixty students, Youth Learning Center quickly gained a reputation for high-quality programs. For 13 years, our after school and summer programming provided youth, grades 1 – 8 with access to 21st century STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, & Math) education, state-of-the-art technology, and rigorous academic support not readily available in their low-income communities. Creative learning opportunities helped students develop basic literacy and math skills while they explored high tech skills such as engineering. Volunteers from corporate supporters and universities like University of Missouri St. Louis, Saint Louis University, and Washington University supported our ability to provide intensive personal attention from caring adult role models helped children realize their potential.\\nDuring the pinnacle of our after school and summer programs, YLC grew to serve approximately 400 children annually, through our premium after-school and summer program, and other specialized program offerings.\\nOur commitment to quality led to program expansion within our own facility and partnerships with the local youth organizations wanting to provide similar programs to their students. In 2012, the quality of our work was noticed by Deaconess Foundation who named YLC as a Deaconess Impact Partner; providing an investment of $700,000 over four years to support staff training, back-office infrastructure, and program development. Youth Learning Center was one of six organizations chosen for the competitive Deaconess Foundation Impact Partnership from among more than one hundred initial applicants.\\n2012 also marked the most significant governance decision of the organization’s history as our Board of Directors voted to explore opening a world-class charter school, The Biome School.\\nOur journey towards opening The Biome began in 2010 when Bill Kent Jr., then Executive Director of YLC, suggested that we could improve our student outcomes through the establishment of a charter school versus after school program of two hours in the evening. The Board of Directors subsequently approved a feasibility study, followed by two years of intensive planning.\\nThe Biome School was incorporated as a subsidiary 501(c)(3) of YLC in 2014 and opened its doors to sixty incredible students on August 1, 2015, marking the culmination of more than a decade of expertise in youth development and education. The Biome School is a model for integrating student-centered learning, project-based opportunities, and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) education.\\nThe Biome began as a K-1 school (in 2015-16) and plans to grow by one grade each year, eventually operating as a K-5 school by 2019-20. The school’s model focuses on building a strong foundation of literacy and math in the early grades (K-2) to ensure that The Biome students are prepared to engage in accelerated and individualized STEAM course-work and projects beginning in grade 3. Students completing our academic program at grade 5 will be on track to thrive in middle school and beyond.\\nDespite our short existence, many would be surprised to learn that the organization’s origins began in the 1940’s, in a small sharecropping community on the outskirts of Shelby Mississippi. In the fields of Shelby is where one of our founders, Willie L. Kent Sr., learned the values of hard work, high standards, self-determination, and faith. His childhood in Shelby also taught him the reality of race and that equality of personhood does not equate to equality of opportunity. At the age of 13, he stood in fields of Shelby and watched daily as school buses drove past the crops in which he spent his days and formative years. Willie grew up without a father and was responsible for helping to support his family. This reality, along with the challenges of poverty and race, made attending school impossible.\\nFrustrated by the lack of opportunity and rejecting life as a sharecropper, Willie left Mississippi at the age of 19 and landed in St. Louis. He married later in life and with a great mechanical mind, succeeded in raising five children and kept the promise that he made himself on a sweltering day in the fields of Shelby. “My children will never be forced to work while other children go to school,” he told himself. Willie kept that promise, but it wasn’t enough. He wanted to provide opportunities for all children, especially those from underserved communities.\\nLiving out his faith, Willie worked to open a homeless shelter, youth gardening program, and youth tutoring programs. Willie took on this commitment as a volunteer while leading a small church and holding a full-time job. With an authentic spirit and soft tone, he was always able to convert others to his service-oriented way of thinking. Inspired by Willie’s passion for service were the co-founders of the Youth Learning Center, Ray Ford, and Judy Deluca Ford.\\nRay and Willie met as co-workers at Buckeye International, a high manufacturer of commercial cleaning related products. Ray and Willie first became acquainted through their work on Willie’s homeless shelter and youth gardening programs. Their friendship was one of mutual respect, admiration, and a shared faith.\\nRay credits Willie as his primary motivator for public service. Ray wanted to help Willie achieve his goal of working with and for young people. When Ray and Judy saw what Willie was doing – helping so many, with so few resources they were inspired. Ray often tells the story of how he believes the Lord spoke to him repeatedly; that Ray was to build a youth center – period. Although Ray tried to say he was retired, the Lord had other plans for him. So instead of retiring to Florida, he returned to St. Louis and embarked on building the Youth Learning Center with Willie.\\nThe YLC facility was constructed with funding from the Ford Family Charitable Fund in 2003. The original build provided 15,000 square feet of learning space until a 2010 renovation added an additional 500 square feet, bringing the current facility square footage to 15,500.\\nRay has always been involved in community service, whether it was the Partner’s Campaign for YMCA for many years, the St. Louis Symphony, his church, missions for relief in Africa, bibles for those in the Middle East or Salvation Army, United Way, local hospitals, animal shelters, the list goes on and on.\\nWith Willie and Ray setting the standards, Youth Learning Center served over 1000 students in its STEM and education programs. Furthering our mission, The Biome School reflects Willie and Ray’s values of hard work, high standards, and self-determination. Their example of faith ensures that love tempers all of our decisions and guides the way in which we serve children and our families; “Our children come first!\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

       "  \"ar \\nWhat's New\\nPosted by \\nGalicia Guerrero | \\nFebruary 9, 2018\\nThe 2018 Gala & Auction: Creating “Boundless” Educational Opportunities\\nThe Biome School Annual Gala and Auction is right around the corner – February 17, 2018. This year, the theme of the gala is “Boundless.” At The Biome, we believe learning is boundless. Our annual gala is where we are able to come together and create boundless possibilities for The Biome. No matter your role in The Biome Community, we believe everyone has the opportunity to contribute to this special event.\\nDamion Jones, Global Director for Diversity and Inclusion at Monsanto, was first introduced to The Biome by his colleague, Deborah Patterson. For Damion, becoming involved with The Biome allowed him to extend his personal passion for STEAM education and building diverse talent in St. Louis beyond his role at Monsanto. Now, as one of our many committed board members, he has taken an active role in helping to spread awareness to why we need to change the way we educate and prepare our future STEAM workforce.\\n“Today, education is not geared to the way young people learn. Honestly, I think the video game industry is really who has learned the right way to engage kids. They give them problems to solve that are rooted in reality. Kids naturally ask why and where will we use this in life? We need to change the way we educate students and provide them with realistic contexts for learning. The jobs of today do not match rote memorization. Rather, they require students to be active problem solvers,” said Jones.\\nThe active, hands-on approach The Biome takes is what inspires Damion. At the Biome, we encourage learners to ask what, why, and how. Curiosity and inquiry shape learning. For example, every grade participates in Big Question units. Big Questions are interdisciplinary projects derived from state and national standards but are guided by the passions and interests of learners. Learners answer questions such as, “What is a scientist?” or “What is energy?” With a Big Question – there isn’t just one right answer. Damion has witnessed the value of Big Questions and echoes the need for this type of learning, “By leading with inquiry, we’re allowing education to be boundless.”\\nThis year, Damion’s advocacy and support for The Biome have been instrumental. In the 2017-2018 academic year, with Damion’s support, The Biome was proud to be awarded a $40,000 grant from the Monsanto Fund to help sustain and grow our innovative, project-based Adaptive Thinking class. Adaptive Thinking is one of The Biome’s core enrichment classes that teaches children to solve problems creatively. Furthermore, at the 2018 Gala, we will be proud to recognize the Monsanto Fund as a Diamond Level sponsor.\\nDamion firmly believes St. Louis has a huge opportunity to become recognized as a hub for building the next generation of diverse STEM leaders. “Consider all the infrastructure already in place – the number of STEM companies, plus the many universities – there should be no reason for St. Louis to not be growing diverse talent.” While many companies are making investments solely at a collegiate level, both Damion and the Monsanto Fund see the importance of investing at the elementary level as well. At the collegiate level, it is often too late and the number of students impacted is limited. Today there are gaps in certain STEM disciplines because many people lack awareness of these careers or are not prepared to enter these fields. Instead of waiting until college, it is important to build connections in kindergarten so that students grow up continually broadening their scope of career possibilities.\\nWe invite you to consider how you can help broaden the scope of possibilities for students in St. Louis.

At The Biome, through our in-house special education program, we have the ability to provide a variety of student support services such as: reading intervention, occupational therapy, special education instruction, behavior intervention and speech-language services. This year, we had the opportunity to bring our speech-language services in-house with our new speech-language pathologist, Emily Schiltz, joining the Biome staff. In addition to having earned her master’s degree in Communications Sciences and Disorders from Saint Louis University, she has more than 15 years of experience working with elementary school-age children, including 10 years working with students at public charter schools in the city.\\nHaving a professional speech-language pathologist on staff, combined with the Biome School’s commitment to putting students’ needs first, has many special advantages.\\nThose who require special services can be diagnosed, assessed and begin receiving the services they require much sooner than at many other public schools across the St. Louis region where the process can take up to 3-4 months. “As soon as a child is identified as needing individualized attention, the Biome is prepared to begin the testing and evaluation necessary to begin providing services. We have internal resources and the flexibility to avoid unnecessary delays caused by waiting for multi-level reviews and approvals,” said Emily. Most recently, the entire process, from the first point of verified concern to the child receiving services, took less than 3 weeks for a Biome student.\\nIn addition, those who are receiving speech and language therapy receive a lot of support from other teachers and administrators within the Biome environment. Emily shared, “Because the staff is so small, so responsive, and so student-focused, everyone will stop what they’re doing when they make their way back to the student’s classroom to listen to the student practice and share in their achievements. These positive interactions allow students to build their confidence and take pride in that others know they are making progress. These interactions also help other adults in the building become more aware of a student’s error patterns, allowing them to communicate more effectively and allowing them to help students practice even when they are not in speech therapy sessions.”\\nThe special education resources of the Biome School will have a lasting impact on students. Research shows that targeted, early, clinical intervention makes a significant impact. When supports are in place, students are able to catch up with their peers much faster, close skills gaps much faster, and reduce costs long-term. Quickly obtaining access to intervention services is essential in assisting children to thrive academically, socially and emotionally.\\nBut with limited financial support from the state of Missouri, funding special services is challenging, especially as a public charter school where we receive\\xa0approximately 25% less in per-pupil funding compared to traditional public schools. Your support is needed to help offset the high cost of special education and speech-language therapy services so the Biome School can continue to provide the individualized attention that can help ensure every child has the opportunity to be successful.\\nTo learn more about how to support and create a lasting impact in the life of a Biome student visit: \\nhttps://thebiomeschool.org/support/\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n11/01/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLaunching a Domino Effect of Support for the Outdoor Learning Center\\nLeave a reply\\nAt The Biome, it is often our dedicated volunteers who act as catalysts, initiating connections that have the potential to create a long-lasting ripple effect.\\nTom Cooke, a member of the Biome Foundation and long-time supporter of the Youth Learning Center, is one of these catalysts. Recently, he brought a special collaboration to the Biome School. In addition to being an accomplished, award-winning executive with a background in public affairs, marketing, and crisis communications, Tom also is active with several other civic and not-for-profit groups and organizations.\\nHe recently identified a special opportunity for a collaboration between the Biome School and the Veiled Prophet Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the 139-year-old organization best known for producing family-friendly events like Fair St Louis and the annual VP Parade. The foundation has provided funding and tens of thousands of hours of volunteer hours for dozens of local community service initiatives.\\nWhile the Veiled Prophet Foundation does not fund entire projects, it does provide the initial financial support that’s necessary to launch each project it selects. It also identifies other funding sources to contribute to the overall cost of the project and arranges in-kind services through the diverse network of VP members. Lastly, the VP taps into its members and their families to volunteer their talents in the construction and final installation of each project. The result is a ripple effect that brings together more people and resources and increases public awareness.\\nThis describes exactly what is happening with the Biome School since Tom initiated the collaboration between the school and the Veiled Prophet Foundation to create our new outdoor learning center, which will be unveiled later this fall.\\nNot only will the new outdoor learning center be an outstanding resource for our students, the collaboration also generated exposure and awareness of the school to a wider audience of community leaders and influencers who share our goal of empowering students by providing them with the tools they need to reach their fullest potential.\\nJust as a commitment from Tom as an individual turned into an exceptional opportunity to benefit our entire student body for years to come, volunteering at any level for the Biome can have a similar “butterfly effect.” Your individual involvement will have a bigger impact than you can imagine.\\nWe invite you to consider how you can ignite your own butterfly effect – where a single action can initiate a widespread ripple effect:\\nIf you are interested in having a hands-on involvement, join us for the Outdoor Learning Center’s final build day on Saturday, November 18th. Sign up to volunteer today by completing our \\nonline form.\\nIf you would like to engage directly with our learners, sign up to become a volunteer in the classroom using our \\nonline form.\\nIf you would like to share your expertise, inquire about board service by contacting Mark Kent at \\nmkent@thebiomefoundation.org\\n.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n11/01/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEngaging our Ecosystem to Build a Strong Literacy Foundation\\nLeave a reply\\nA Biome (noun): is an ecosystem that includes all of the living things in a given area, interacting with each other, and with their non-living environments, all together as an ecological unit.\\nAt The Biome School, our approach focuses on engaging every aspect of our ecosystem in order to support student learning. When a system is designed based on the needs of our students, we create a strong, enriching environment for learning. Evidence of this system’s efficacy is seen through The Biome’s holistic approach to literacy.\\nMrs. Laura Cortner, Reading Specialist at The Biome, brings more than 11 years of experience in early childhood education and literacy. She emphasizes, “Literacy is the foundation for all subjects. It is core to building skills in other subjects and engaging in project-based learning. In order to best support learners, we all must be active in creating a literacy-rich environment.”\\nAt The Biome School, we implement a balanced comprehensive literacy program that meets the individual needs of every student. Within a reading and writing workshop model, students experience whole group, small group, and individualized instruction regularly. Small group work may include guided reading groups, literature circles, or strategy groups. Teachers organize instruction so every child regularly receives direct, explicit reading instruction as his/her level.\\nResearch shows that this explicit, individualized approach is critical. By 3 years of age, there is a 30 million-word gap between children from the wealthiest and poorest families. Two-thirds of kindergartners show up their first day already behind national literacy benchmarks. What is important to recognize is that children lack the opportunities to interact with rich language, it’s not just throwing words at children, but making sure they hear new concepts, things of interest to them, so their brains make those connections earlier (Sparks, 2015).\\nWhat is important about The Biome’s ecosystem approach is that it recognizes the value of community involvement in supporting literacy – we know it takes more to adequately support and meet the varied needs of learners. Additional integrations of literacy that all took place in just the last month included: parent education nights, curriculum days, parent-teacher conferences, literacy mornings, and our scholastic book fair. The parent education and curriculum days helped equip parents in promoting a literacy-rich environment and learn how to adopt reading strategies and practices at home and they encouraged parents to be positive models for reading. The scholastic book fair raised funds to allow us to purchase needed reading materials. The literacy mornings encouraged students to practice and receive direct attention and support from family and volunteers. Last, 50 students benefit from direct reading intervention, which provides them with 120 extra minutes of explicit, direct instruction every week with our reading specialist.\\nNot only do these multiple integrations support literacy skill development, but it also helps students to foster a positive relationship with reading. Success is not just measured in scores, but also in hearing students use positive self-identifying language. They say, “Mrs. Cortner, Mrs. Cortner, I know because as a reader, I would…” Mrs. Cortner echoed this reality, “ When they recognize themselves as readers, they become readers.”\\nWe invite you to be apart of the literacy ecosystem at The Biome. Any level of involvement, from joining us for a literacy morning or helping to fund classroom libraries, your support strengths our ecosystem and contributes to students building a strong foundation of literacy – a skillset that will serve them their entire lives.\\nTo contribute to The Biome ecosystem, consider taking part in one of the following activities today:\\nIf you are interested in supporting the literacy program or making a donation to support student learning, please go to:\\xa0\\nhttps://thebiomeschool.org/support/\\nIf you would like to engage directly with our learners, sign up to volunteer at our upcoming Literacy Morning on December 1st using our \\nonline form.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n11/01/2017\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

       "  'Monthly Archives: May 2018\\nLearning Beyond Our School Walls\\nLeave a reply\\nAt The Biome, we are striving to expand our learning ecosystem beyond our classrooms and into the community. We believe learning takes place everywhere. In St. Louis, we are fortunate to have incredible community assets such as a world-class zoo. Partnering with the Saint Louis Zoo, we’ve created an immersive, experiential learning experience for our second grade learners.\\nA core aspect of The Biome School curriculum is the incorporation of Big Question units. These units encourage learners to ask and answer real world questions. Projects are then designed based on the project based learning model or PBL. In PBL, students work on a project over an extended period of time (from a week up to a semester) that engages them in solving a real-world problem or answering a complex question. They demonstrate their knowledge and skills by developing a public product or presentation for a real audience. Research has shown that students learning through PBL retain content longer and have a deeper understanding of what they are learning (BIE, 2013).\\n“When we think about experiential learning at The Biome School, it isn’t about doing projects there at the school. We want our kids out in the community; it needs to be real world. We want them to experience the city of St. Louis – but, also, develop relationships with other adults in the community,” explains Bill Kent, President & CEO of The Biome.\\nThis year, for the second grade zoo school experience, learners took on the challenge of researching the activity levels of different animals at the Zoo. To prepare for the onsite research experience, learners began brainstorming questions, creating preliminary maps, and gaining exposure to animals as St. Louis Zookeepers brought in a variety of animals such as snakes, turtles, and birds into the classroom.\\nFrom February 26 through March 5, our learners packed up their backpacks, grabbed their iPads, and we’re ready to hit the zoo. Using the iPad tool, Observe to Learn, learners took to observing animals, collecting data, and creating ethograms. Further, throughout the week, learners had the opportunity to make the Zoo their own. Daily, they interacted with the Zoo staff, created maps, measured distances, fed animals, practiced wayfinding, and worked together to solve problems.\\nLearning did not end once our learners were back in their classrooms at The Biome. Learners discovered the hard work of documenting their scientific work. Together, they created animal poems, developed a large-scale visual map, and reported their work through the scientific method documenting their question, hypotheses, procedures, and results.\\nSo what did our learners think of their experience at the Zoo? They felt like true researchers! Tayonna, 2nd grade learner expressed, “I loved investigating the animals. It was exciting to go every single day and learn in new places.”\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n05/30/2018\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nThe Biome Grows Readers\\nLeave a reply\\nThere remains a dire need to help students improve literacy skills and guide them on a pathway to success. We know that children who do not read proficiently by the end of third grade are four times more likely to leave school without a diploma than proficient readers.\\nIt is crucial that children master grade-level reading by 3rd grade because that is when instruction moves from a focus on learning to read to reading to learn. Basic reading skills become vital for continued learning in other subjects, like math and science. Without these foundational skills, students are unable to keep up with their peers and continue to fall farther and farther behind. (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2010, 2017) Worse yet, the ability to overcome literacy challenges only increases overtime – 85% of all juveniles who come in contact with the juvenile court system are functionally illiterate.\\nAt The Biome, we recognize early intervention is critical in supporting students. We refuse to let students fall behind. To combat these statistics, we believe in providing all students with reading intervention and many other specialized services – all at no cost to our families.\\xa0\\nSynia, a highly motivated, creative, and fun-loving second grader is an incredible example of the impact of this type of support. Synia loves reading fairytale stories, practicing multiplication, and creating new games on the playground with her friends. When she entered 2nd\\xa0grade, she was identified as below grade level in reading. Rather than avoiding this challenge, Synia eagerly looked forward to building her skills during reading intervention with Ms. Cortner, our reading specialist. Weekly they would work together on both reading and writing. Ms. Cortner expressed, “Synia really identifies as a reader and a writer and this is huge! She will say, ‘as I reader I know I can use a strategy like chunking to help me.’ Each time she finished a book you could see her confidence grow.”\\nToday,\\xa0Synia\\xa0can proudly show each and every reading strategy she uses to conquer one book after another.\\xa0This past April, Synia graduated from individualized reading intervention, moved up nine levels in reading, and is now on\\xa0level\\xa0for second grade.\\xa0\\nIn order to continue to provide this extraordinary level of support for our students, we must meet our fiscal year fundraising goal. Next year, we will hit our next major milestone – opening fourth grade. Your support will allow us to continue to expand and grow The Biome School Community.\\nYour contribution will help our current students lay the groundwork for their future success and strengthen our community.

This year, the theme of the gala is “Boundless.” At The Biome, we believe learning is boundless. Our annual gala is where we are able to come together and create boundless possibilities for The Biome. No matter your role in The Biome Community, we believe everyone has the opportunity to contribute to this special event.\\nDamion Jones, Global Director for Diversity and Inclusion at Monsanto, was first introduced to The Biome by his colleague, Deborah Patterson. For Damion, becoming involved with The Biome allowed him to extend his personal passion for STEAM education and building diverse talent in St. Louis beyond his role at Monsanto. Now, as one of our many committed board members, he has taken an active role in helping to spread awareness to why we need to change the way we educate and prepare our future STEAM workforce.\\n“Today, education is not geared to the way young people learn. Honestly, I think the video game industry is really who has learned the right way to engage kids. They give them problems to solve that are rooted in reality. Kids naturally ask why and where will we use this in life? We need to change the way we educate students and provide them with realistic contexts for learning. The jobs of today do not match rote memorization. Rather, they require students to be active problem solvers,” said Jones.\\nThe active, hands-on approach The Biome takes is what inspires Damion. At the Biome, we encourage learners to ask what, why, and how. Curiosity and inquiry shape learning. For example, every grade participates in Big Question units. Big Questions are interdisciplinary projects derived from state and national standards but are guided by the passions and interests of learners. Learners answer questions such as, “What is a scientist?” or “What is energy?” With a Big Question – there isn’t just one right answer. Damion has witnessed the value of Big Questions and echoes the need for this type of learning, “By leading with inquiry, we’re allowing education to be boundless.”\\nThis year, Damion’s advocacy and support for The Biome have been instrumental. In the 2017-2018 academic year, with Damion’s support, The Biome was proud to be awarded a $40,000 grant from the Monsanto Fund to help sustain and grow our innovative, project-based Adaptive Thinking class. Adaptive Thinking is one of The Biome’s core enrichment classes that teaches children to solve problems creatively. Furthermore, at the 2018 Gala, we will be proud to recognize the Monsanto Fund as a Diamond Level sponsor.\\nDamion firmly believes St. Louis has a huge opportunity to become recognized as a hub for building the next generation of diverse STEM leaders. “Consider all the infrastructure already in place – the number of STEM companies, plus the many universities – there should be no reason for St. Louis to not be growing diverse talent.” While many companies are making investments solely at a collegiate level, both Damion and the Monsanto Fund see the importance of investing at the elementary level as well. At the collegiate level, it is often too late and the number of students impacted is limited. Today there are gaps in certain STEM disciplines because many people lack awareness of these careers or are not prepared to enter these fields. Instead of waiting until college, it is important to build connections in kindergarten so that students grow up continually broadening their scope of career possibilities.\\nWe invite you to consider how you can help broaden the scope of possibilities for students in St. Louis. To learn more about ways to support the 2018 Gala, \\nvisit our webpage\\n. We would love for you to join us at the gala, where boundless possibilities will be created.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n02/09/2018\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nThe Biome Outdoor Learning Space Featured in The Ladue News\\nLeave a reply\\nThe Biome was proud to be featured in Ladue News on January 4, 2018.

From providing one-on-one tutoring to small group instruction, AmeriCorps teaching assistants embrace the Biome’s commitment to helping every learner achieve his or her potential.\\nHaving AmeriCorps members in classrooms is the result of The Biome School having been chosen last summer to receive a Federal AmeriCorps grant award for the 2017-2018 school year from the Missouri Community Service Commission. In addition to providing daily academic support for the Biome’s STEAM curriculum, AmeriCorps members also participate in PATHS programming, which helps support learner’s social-emotional skills such as self-control, self-esteem and problem-solving.\\nThe positive impact of this additional funding happens every day at The Biome School. For example, one of the AmeriCorps teaching assistants, Ivette Lozano, grew up in California in a low-income environment herself. She understands first-hand the value of early intervention for learners who may be struggling either academically or emotionally. “Just knowing that someone cares and is available to give a learner the extra time and attention he or she needs directly impacts learning success,” said Ivette. “It not only enhances a learner’s self-confidence, it can inspire them to want to achieve more.”\\nIvette works primarily with learners in kindergarten and first grade at The Biome. On a typical day, while the classroom teacher may be leading a general writing lesson, Ivette may be working separately with a small group of four learners, helping them improve their reading comprehension or understand how to put their thoughts in writing and use proper sentence structure. Another day, she may work one-on-one with a learner on how to use communication skills to better manage social interactions. “When I hear a learner apologize for accidentally bumping into a classmate, I know I’ve had an impact that may last a lifetime,” said Ivette. She added that joining AmeriCorps at The Biome has inspired her to become a kindergarten teacher\\xa0instead of an upper elementary teacher.\\nFor kindergarten teacher Kristin Williams, having an AmeriCorps member in the classroom benefits everyone. “At the beginning of the school year, I walked into a classroom of 16 very lively and enthusiastic five- and six-year-olds, including some children who had never attended a preschool and had no experience in a classroom setting. With Ivette’s help, we were able to help our young learners make a faster adjustment by giving them the one-on-one attention they need at that age,” said Kristin.\\nToday, from reading site words to doing math problems independently, every learner in Kristin’s kindergarten is making tremendous progress. “It is gratifying to see how every day our learners are becoming more independent and self-motivated,” said Kristin, who added that her goal is to have every kindergartner in her classroom reading and doing math at first-grade level by the end of the school year.\\nAlthough Kristin and Ivette did not know each other prior to the first day of school last August, they discovered that they not only have similar teaching styles, backgrounds and experiences, they are both former cheerleaders. “We have a good time coming up with cheers and chants that we use as teaching tools to make learning fun and interesting,” said Kristin. “We want the positive experience our learners have in kindergarten to inspire them to achieve success throughout their entire academic future.”\\nThe impact of the AmeriCorps grant cannot be understated. As Bill Kent, The Biome’s founder and CEO, said, “The importance of this additional funding ensures that we are able to provide the rigorous, experiential, and holistic education we are committed to providing for every learner who comes through our doors.”\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n02/09/2018\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMind & Movement: Not the PE Class You Remember\\nLeave a reply\\nAt The Biome, there’s a new twist being placed on gym class. No longer are the days of simple jumping jacks, timed miles, and pushing through as many sit-ups as you can. Today, in Mind and Movement, students explore a wider range of physical learning activities and discover how the mind is connected to physical learning. Through a variety of themed classes, from Tennis Tuesday to Yoga Thursday, learners engage in whole body learning.\\nAshreale McDowell, who comes to The Biome with a rich performing arts background, leads Mind and Movement. She received a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts degree from Webster University and since then has performed and taught professionally at a number of companies and schools. Currently, she is also a performing artist at Consuming Kinetics Dance Company.\\nIn Mind & Movement, learners are able to take a break from the traditional classroom setting. They are given the freedom to move and to express themselves in new ways. The opportunity to teach and build the Mind & Movement program at The Biome has been an exciting and creative experience for Ms. McDowell. At The Biome, she has the freedom to structure her class in a way that exposes students to a variety of moment, unlike other teaching experiences where she was required following a more regimented program. For example, every week, learners participate in fun, interactive yoga classes. Recent research has shown that yoga and mindfulness improve both physical and mental health in school-age children. Yoga improves balance, strength, endurance, and aerobic capacity in children. Yoga can also improve focus, memory, self-esteem, academic performance, and classroom behavior, and can even reduce anxiety and stress in children (Wei, 2016). Every week learners also participate in dance classes. Dance allows the learners to practice learning choreography, memorize movements, and improve their memory.\\nIn Mind & Movement, Ms. McDowell also actively incorporates lessons about the human body and health. Ms. McDowell shared, “As learners grow and strengthen their physical bodies, it is also important for them to understand how all their muscles work and are connected to different movements.”\\nSince the beginning of the year, Ms. McDowell has seen students increasingly step outside of their comfort zones and build their confidence. Often, when something is new, she will hear students say, “I can’t do this. My body can’t do that. I don’t think I’m going to be good.” Yet, in December, at the recent Winter Festival performances, she witnessed the growth of students. The same students who were reluctant at first came out of their shells and proudly performed for an audience of over 100 parents, family, and friends.\\nAt The Biome, we believe in providing students with a holistic educational experience. Mind & Movement is just one more aspect of our educational model that helps students to build important perseverance and self-regulation skills. Rather than with just regular physical education classes, Mind & Movement helps learners to build both healthy bodies and healthy minds.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n on \\n02/09/2018\\n by \\nGalicia Guerrero\\n.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nArchives\\nMay 2018\\nApril 2018\\nMarch 2018\\nFebruary 2018\\nDecember 2017\\nNovember 2017\\nOctober 2017\\nSeptember 2017\\nAugust 2017\\nJune 2017\\nJune 2015\\nDecember 2014\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

The purpose of STEAM education is to strive for “functional literacy – an ability to transfer knowledge with higher-order thinking between disciplines” (Yakman 2012). Science and technology principles are interpreted through engineering and the arts, and all are based in mathematical elements. By integrating learning areas in this way, The Biome helps to develop well-rounded students who are able to think across disciplines to problem-solve and apply learning to real-world scenarios.\\nOur teaching method centers on building knowledge and skill through meaningful experiences.\\n\\xa0 Students learn through implementing knowledge directly, such as by creating digital animation and video game designs.\\nWe believe that integrating science, technology, engineering, art and mathematic curricula helps engage our students while providing fun and inspiring new ways to grasp complicated materials.\\n\\xa0 Art and design have a great presence in our everyday lives and should be represented more prominently in education. An understanding and appreciation for art helps students profoundly when tackling complex problems and lessons.\\nDesign is an integral component of many of the products and technological advances that drive our economy and improve our lives. Creative exploration and experimentation exercises the brain, helping fuel breakthroughs in science, technology, engineering, product development and more.\\n\\xa0 The Biome’s focus on STEAM education cultivates an atmosphere of imagination, innovation and expressiveness – qualities crucial in the development of 21st century leaders.\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.

Big Questions are our interdisciplinary project units derived from state and national standards but guided by the passions and interests of our students. Our classroom leaders enjoy “uncovering” information related to our Big Questions alongside our learners. \\xa0The units facilitate understanding about how topics are interconnected and help\\xa0our learners understand why skills matter and how to apply them beyond the classroom. \\xa0Big Questions tend to be centered around a science or social studies topic, and integrates\\xa0language arts and math as central tools within learner investigations.\\nWe strive to build strong foundations in literacy. Learning to read and write well for a variety of purposes is essential for success in all areas of study.\\nMathematics is another foundational subject around which we provide deep and focused instruction. It offers engaging lessons and continuous feedback to both learners and teachers on progress.\\nThrough our School-Wide Enrichment, Master Class Programs, and Pop-up Micro-Schools, learners undertake a deep exploration into subjects of interest, including art, coding, chess, and game design. Ultimately, we lead our students to develop academic mastery and provide them with the necessary experiences and relationships to succeed as they advance and eventually graduate from The Biome.\\nPrint / PDF / Email\\nEducation\\nApproach\\nSTEAM\\nCurriculum\\nEnrollment Process\\nForms\\nCurrent Families\\nContact\\nForms\\nAbout Us\\nThe Biome\\nYLC\\nOur Board\\nFAQs\\nConnect with The Biome\\n314-531-0982\\ninfo@thebiomeschool.org\\nThe Biome School\\n\\r            4471 Olive Street\\n\\r            Saint Louis, Missouri 63108\\r            \\n©2014 The Biome School.
