We’re proud of our district and hope you are as well!\\nGetaways on a Budget\\nGetting away from the everyday hustle and bustle can be wonderful. Unfortunately, many families are financially strapped and never take that much-needed weekend getaway. With so many discount and coupon websites available, however, a weekend trip with the family is much cheaper than you might think!\\nHere are a few pointers to help you find the best deals for your family excursion…\\nLocation:\\nChoose a location you can drive to. For a weekend trip, you want to maximize the time at your chosen destination, so keeping your drive-time to four hours or less is recommended. Draw a four-hour radius around your hometown, and decide which city within that circle would be the most fun for your family to visit. The larger the city, the more activities and discounts you will find.\\nHotel:\\nWebsites like \\nHotwire.com\\n will give you a list of hotels within the vicinity of where you’re going. Decide on the price you’re willing to spend on a room, and choose the highest rated hotel within your price range. You’ll be surprised at the low rates you can find for high-quality hotels!\\nTripAdvisor\\n can be helpful in your hotel search, too. Not only does it provide reviews on hotels within your price range, but it also provides key information about parking, nearby attractions, and even available discounts. Once you’ve found a hotel, bed and breakfast, or other lodging option, \\nTripAdvisor\\n will search multiple discount sites simultaneously and help you get the best value for your money.\\nActivities:\\nWhat you do on your getaway can make or break the trip. To maximize your spending cash, subscribe to discount sites like \\nGroupon\\n or \\nLivingSocial\\n, and watch for entertainment deals in your destination city. These deals can range anywhere from paintball and laser tag to local water parks, spas, and restaurants. By arranging activities through these discount sites, you are guaranteed to save at least 50% off the retail value for your excursion.\\nSearching your destination city’s Convention and Visitor’s Bureau (CVB) website is another great way to save on entertainment. These sites often have links to coupons and discounts. Check out the \\nKansas City CVB\\n for an example.\\nLastly, let \\nGoogle\\n do the work for you. Search “coupons for (your destination),” and see all the wonderful sites that come up!\\nIn short, the key is to take the time to plan and research your trip. By following the above guidelines, you will find deals you didn’t even know were available. Plus, with all of the cash you save, you’ll already be well on your way to saving for your next getaway!\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmaster',\n",
       " ' INTERMEDIATE ACADEMY\\n“The school where every challenge becomes a mission accomplished.\\n”\\nOur History\\nAccelerated Interdisciplinary Intermediate Academy was founded by Kevin Hicks and Dr. David C. Fuller in 2001. AIA is an open enrollment charter school serving Houston and Lancaster. AIA gives students the benefits of a private school education free of charge.\\nAIA does all it can to make sure that each child learns. By providing built-in extended day hours, children have the opportunity to get extra help if they need it. AIA also offers Saturday tutorials for students who need one-on-one tutoring help.\\r\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nA charter school is a nonsectarian public school of choice that operates with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. The \"charter\" establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school\\'s mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success.\\nThe length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school\\'s contract. Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor–usually a state or local school board–to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract.\\nThe basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters',\n",

If summer school was required, the student must pass the math and reading released STAAR test. If a student does not pass the appropriate test, he/she must enroll in the retained grade as stated on the official/final report card.\\nStudents seeking enrollment who were not in attendance 90 percent or more of the school days of the prior school year must take and pass an AIA STAAR Released Test/Grade Placement Test in order for us to consider them for promotion at AIA.\\nWe require students who fail STAAR and go to summer school at a campus other than AIA, to pass an AIA STAAR Release Test in order for us to promote them. Otherwise, we will admit them into the same grade as the prior school year.\\nWe will monitor the student and evaluate his/her progress for the first six weeks of school. He/She must have satisfactory scores on the following:\\nPassing grades in all core subjects on report card\\n70% or above on benchmark tests\\nDiscipline history\\n\\rIf the student meets all of the above mentioned requirements, we will promote him/her to the next grade level.\\nStudents enrolling from private schools must have satisfactory scores on the Stanford 10, ITBS, etc. that are equivalent to passing scores on the STAAR test. If not, the student will follow the outlined requirements above.\\nAIA wishes to enroll all deserving students who will benefit from its educational program. Therefore, AIA reserves the right to deny student admission for the following reasons:\\nExtensive and documented discipline violations\\nPrior adjudication\\nMaximum capacity reached at student’s grade level\\nIf we find that a student enrolls with falsified records and/or withheld discipline history, we will immediately withdraw him/her from school.\\nIf the school admits a student and finds out later that the student did not pass STAAR or STAAR Released Test in summer school, we will place the student in his/her last grade completed.\\xa0\\nIn its admissions policies and procedures, AIA does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual preference, or national/ethnic origin. It maintains a “waiting pool” and conducts a lottery when there are more student applicants than classroom vacancies. Once we determine that a child may be admitted to AIA, a family may complete the enrollment process.\\nRe-enrollment\\nPer our admission policy, all returning students must have a completed re-enrollment packet on file by the last day of February.

We’re proud of our district and hope you are as well!\\nGetaways on a Budget\\nGetting away from the everyday hustle and bustle can be wonderful. Unfortunately, many families are financially strapped and never take that much-needed weekend getaway. With so many discount and coupon websites available, however, a weekend trip with the family is much cheaper than you might think!\\nHere are a few pointers to help you find the best deals for your family excursion…\\nLocation:\\nChoose a location you can drive to. For a weekend trip, you want to maximize the time at your chosen destination, so keeping your drive-time to four hours or less is recommended. Draw a four-hour radius around your hometown, and decide which city within that circle would be the most fun for your family to visit. The larger the city, the more activities and discounts you will find.\\nHotel:\\nWebsites like \\nHotwire.com\\n will give you a list of hotels within the vicinity of where you’re going. Decide on the price you’re willing to spend on a room, and choose the highest rated hotel within your price range. You’ll be surprised at the low rates you can find for high-quality hotels!\\nTripAdvisor\\n can be helpful in your hotel search, too. Not only does it provide reviews on hotels within your price range, but it also provides key information about parking, nearby attractions, and even available discounts. Once you’ve found a hotel, bed and breakfast, or other lodging option, \\nTripAdvisor\\n will search multiple discount sites simultaneously and help you get the best value for your money.\\nActivities:\\nWhat you do on your getaway can make or break the trip. To maximize your spending cash, subscribe to discount sites like \\nGroupon\\n or \\nLivingSocial\\n, and watch for entertainment deals in your destination city. These deals can range anywhere from paintball and laser tag to local water parks, spas, and restaurants. By arranging activities through these discount sites, you are guaranteed to save at least 50% off the retail value for your excursion.\\nSearching your destination city’s Convention and Visitor’s Bureau (CVB) website is another great way to save on entertainment. These sites often have links to coupons and discounts. Check out the \\nKansas City CVB\\n for an example.\\nLastly, let \\nGoogle\\n do the work for you. Search “coupons for (your destination),” and see all the wonderful sites that come up!\\nIn short, the key is to take the time to plan and research your trip. By following the above guidelines, you will find deals you didn’t even know were available. Plus, with all of the cash you save, you’ll already be well on your way to saving for your next getaway!\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",

Fuller in 2001. AIA is an open enrollment charter school serving Houston and Lancaster. AIA gives students the benefits of a private school education free of charge.\\nAIA does all it can to make sure that each child learns. By providing built-in extended day hours, children have the opportunity to get extra help if they need it. AIA also offers Saturday tutorials for students who need one-on-one tutoring help.\\r\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nA charter school is a nonsectarian public school of choice that operates with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. The \"charter\" establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school\\'s mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success.\\nThe length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school\\'s contract. Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor–usually a state or local school board–to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract.\\nThe basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",

If summer school was required, the student must pass the math and reading released STAAR test. If a student does not pass the appropriate test, he/she must enroll in the retained grade as stated on the official/final report card.\\nStudents seeking enrollment who were not in attendance 90 percent or more of the school days of the prior school year must take and pass an AIA STAAR Released Test/Grade Placement Test in order for us to consider them for promotion at AIA.\\nWe require students who fail STAAR and go to summer school at a campus other than AIA, to pass an AIA STAAR Release Test in order for us to promote them. Otherwise, we will admit them into the same grade as the prior school year.\\nWe will monitor the student and evaluate his/her progress for the first six weeks of school. He/She must have satisfactory scores on the following:\\nPassing grades in all core subjects on report card\\n70% or above on benchmark tests\\nDiscipline history\\n\\rIf the student meets all of the above mentioned requirements, we will promote him/her to the next grade level.\\nStudents enrolling from private schools must have satisfactory scores on the Stanford 10, ITBS, etc. that are equivalent to passing scores on the STAAR test. If not, the student will follow the outlined requirements above.\\nAIA wishes to enroll all deserving students who will benefit from its educational program. Therefore, AIA reserves the right to deny student admission for the following reasons:\\nExtensive and documented discipline violations\\nPrior adjudication\\nMaximum capacity reached at student’s grade level\\nIf we find that a student enrolls with falsified records and/or withheld discipline history, we will immediately withdraw him/her from school.\\nIf the school admits a student and finds out later that the student did not pass STAAR or STAAR Released Test in summer school, we will place the student in his/her last grade completed.\\xa0\\nIn its admissions policies and procedures, AIA does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual preference, or national/ethnic origin. It maintains a “waiting pool” and conducts a lottery when there are more student applicants than classroom vacancies. Once we determine that a child may be admitted to AIA, a family may complete the enrollment process.\\nRe-enrollment\\nPer our admission policy, all returning students must have a completed re-enrollment packet on file by the last day of February. Re-enrollment for new students will begin on January 15.\\nForms and Information\\nApplication for Admissions\\xa0\\nEnrollment Forms\\nFree/Reduced Meal Application\\nParent and Student Handbook\\xa0\\nRe-Enrollment Application\\xa0\\nStart-Up School Supply List\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",

Fuller in 2001. AIA is an open enrollment charter school serving Houston and Lancaster. AIA gives students the benefits of a private school education free of charge.\\nAIA does all it can to make sure that each child learns. By providing built-in extended day hours, children have the opportunity to get extra help if they need it. AIA also offers Saturday tutorials for students who need one-on-one tutoring help.\\r\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nA charter school is a nonsectarian public school of choice that operates with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. The \"charter\" establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school\\'s mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success.\\nThe length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school\\'s contract. Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor–usually a state or local school board–to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract.\\nThe basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",
