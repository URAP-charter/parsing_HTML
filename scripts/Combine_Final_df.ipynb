Our focus is on giving each students the foundation needed to be a prepared, creative, passionate, and curious learner who will be successful in creativity, college and career. First, that means making sure that they can read, write and do math. It means engaging our students through project-based learning, providing a firm foundation in art and design at a time when such subjects are being cut by many schools, and instilling a love of learning from their very first day at HFA: Elementary School.\\xa0\\nWhere is the school located? HFA: Elementary School is located at the recently renovated Duane Doty Elementary School in Detroit’s Northend community at 10225 Third St., Detroit, MI 48202. This historic building is on the edge of the Boston-Edison District, just west of Woodward, between the Davison Freeway and Chicago Blvd.\\xa0\\nWhere does learning take place? Our facility and its 21st century school design supports our educational program. HFA: Elementary School offers academic learning studios, a technology/media center, art and design studios, an exhibition hall, three open-learning commons areas, a dining hall, an administrative and reception suite, \\xa0student support studios, and a moderate-sized gymnasium with an assembly and performance stage. Students also learn in the greater community. We believe that education is truly about experiencing the world all around and teaching students to apply their knowledge to develop creative solutions to real-world problems.\\nHow is the academic calendar structured?\\xa0The school year runs from September to late June with appropriate vacations, including a mid-winter break. It aligns with the Wayne County Common Calendar. Additionally, there are half days scheduled periodically throughout the school year – on Wednesdays – for teacher professional development sessions. These sessions are designed to provide staff with more frequent opportunities to work together in reviewing student learning progress and making plans to adjust teaching to better serve your children. This is a very common practice in high performing schools and one that we feel will help us reach our goals.\\nWhat is a school day like?\\xa0The school day begins at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 3:40 p.m., Monday through Friday. Early release days end at 1:30 p.m. All students receive instruction in Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies.

Contact Staci Williams, Manager of Community Engagement, at 313-414-9950 or swilliams@hfli.org.\\nHow can I be sure that HFA: Elementary School is a quality school? \\xa0HFA: Elementary School is developed and managed by Henry Ford Learning Institute (HFLI), a non-profit organization that offers highly regarded and innovative educational programs developed in partnership with other exemplary educational institutions. Families can be assured that the curriculum meets all state guidelines and national standards. Every instructor is highly qualified and holds a valid State of Michigan teaching certificate as a requirement of employment. We also have the support of corporate and community partners who, along with our parents, hold us to a high level of achievement. Our school district was designated by P21 as a 2015-2016 National 21st Century Learning Exemplar for our innovative teaching and learning practices; the HFA: SCS K-12 district is the first P21 Exemplar in Michigan.\\xa0\\nWhat is the connection to Henry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies?\\xa0\\nStudents who complete 5th grade at HFA: Elementary School will automatically be enrolled as 6th graders at \\nHenry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies\\n (HFA: SCS), a public charter middle/high school serving grades 6 through 12. HFA: SCS is a Thompson Foundation 90/90 school, committed to graduating 90% of its students and sending at least 90% of those graduates on to college. HFA: SCS is located in the A. Alfred Taubman Center for Design Education at 485 W. Milwaukee St., Detroit. Both schools are located in Detroit's Northend neighborhood.\\nWhat is an enrollment lottery?\\xa0If there are more applications submitted by the deadline date (April 7, 2017) than available seats for a particular grade, HFA: Elementary School will hold a random selection lottery on April 14, 2017. All lottery applications will be drawn and placed on either the acceptance list or the waiting list for each grade based on the number they receive in the lottery. Please contact us at the number below with any questions.\\nWhat happens if my student’s name is added to the waitlist at the lottery?\\xa0Students on the acceptance list have until the enrollment date to accept their spot at our school for the 2017-2018 school year.  If a student does not accept that seat by that date, HFA: Elementary School will offer that seat to the next eligible person on the waitlist.\\nWhat are the chances that both of my children will be admitted?\\xa0Each child must meet the eligibility requirements (lives in the State of Michigan, is of appropriate age for the selected grade and has formal records to indicate they are prepared to enter the selected grade), must complete the application for enrollment form and submit that form prior to the enrollment deadline (April 28, 2017). If one child’s application is selected during the random lottery, both students will automatically be offered an enrollment seat. Please note that families are not eligible for the automatic sibling preference for enrollment if they do not submit individual applications for each student and/or do not fill out the sibling statement on the application.\\nIs there a school uniform?\\xa0Yes. Like many other schools of choice, our students wear solid color shirts with a school logo and navy or black pants or skirts. A hoodie and a fleece with the school logo are also available for chilly days.\\nWhat about transportation?\\xa0Like many schools, HFA: Elementary School does not provide free bus service.\\nUpdated 03/6/2017\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites\"), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/how-to-attend/information-sessions', 'False', '1', '\\nPlease join Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School for \\nan Open House!\\xa0\\nLearn about our K-5 school,\\xa0meet our teachers and staff, see our beautiful facility and apply for the 2018-2019 school year.\\nWhen:\\nFebruary 7, 2018 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nMarch 7, 2018 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nMarch 21st\\n\\xa0 from\\xa0\\n4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nApril 11, 2018 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nApril 18th\\nScience Night & Open House from\\xa0\\n4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nMay 9, 2018 from 4:30 to 5:30pm\\nWho:\\xa0\\nOpen Houses are for families of new students entering grades K-5. \\xa0\\nKindergarten Kickoff is for families of students entering Kindergarten in Fall 2019 (only).

The decision to close school due to weather conditions, therefore,  is always a difficult one. \\n  With this month’s record snowfalls and extreme low temperatures, we’ve weighed on the side of student and staff safety a number of times, cancelling a scheduled day of instruction. \\n  Who makes the call to close school? It’s not just a single person, but a team comprised of your school principals, Acting Superintendent Nan Gill, HFLI Executive Director Deborah Parizek, with support from our facilities and communications team members.  They consider a number of factors when predictions of inclement weather arise: \\n·       The conditions of main roads and side streets and the likelihood they will be cleared; \\n·       Meteorologists’ forecasts (along with a healthy amount of skepticism to avoid any hype); \\n·       The safety of not only those who are driving to school, but our students who walk or take public transportation; and \\n·       The decisions of our colleagues across Metro Detroit, including other PSAD schools and at Detroit Public Schools. \\n  Why do we take other school closings into consideration? It’s our experience that attendance at our schools is lower when the surrounding public school system is closed. When our attendance is below 75% on a given day, the state can take away a day’s funding. \\n  Also factored into the decision is the state’s limit of six snow days; we may have to make up the days in the summer or cut other scheduled breaks short if we go past that number. \\n We do our very best to make a call to cancel school the night before a school closing, so our families and staff can make any necessary adjustments to their daily plans. We post notifications to our Facebook pages and web sites, and through the consolidated school closing reporting system which pushes our notifications out to local media outlets. We also activate our SchoolReach system to call our families and staff directly. \\n  In the event we don’t have enough conclusive information during evening hours, and we do have to make a decision in the morning, we do our best to any announcements by 6:00 a.m. through the same notification process to families, staff and the public. \\n  We hope this information is helpful in understanding our decisions to keep our schools open, or to close, during inclement weather. \\n  In the meantime, please know that the education and safety of your child is our top priority -- and please join us in hopeful thoughts of warm sunshine, budding trees, and clear roads.  \\nDr. Curtis Lewis \\nFounding Principal \\nHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School \\nRashid Faisal \\nPrincipal \\nHenry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies\\nComments\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/annualeducationreportsaernowavailable', 'False', '1', ' \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:51 AM by Lisa Kreinbring                                        \\xa0                      \\n                        [          updated \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:52 AM]                      \\nWe are pleased to present school and district-level Annual Education Reports (AER) and cover letters which provide key information on the 2012-2013 educational progress for Henry Ford Academy Elementary School and its school district.\\nČ\\nUpdating...\\nĊ\\nDistrict AER Cover and Report 2012-2013.pdf\\n(252k)\\nLisa Kreinbring, \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:51 AM\\nv.1\\nď\\nĊ\\nHFAES School AER Cover and Report 2012-2013.pdf\\n(222k)\\nLisa Kreinbring, \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:51 AM\\nv.1\\nď\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/april2015newsletter', 'False', '1', ' \\nApr 3, 2015, 4:32 PM by tjubert@hfaes.org                                        \\xa0                      \\n                        [          updated \\nApr 3, 2015, 4:34 PM]                      \\nGreetings HFA: Elementary School families.

Dr. Lewis received hisaward during a celebration at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African AmericanHistory on Friday, Octobe\\nr 25, 2013.\\nIn her nomination, Henry Ford Academy: Elementary Schoolparent Dr. Kimberly Elyse wrote at length about his impact not only on theschool’s students, but als\\no their parents:\\n“\\nDr. Lewis takes time toteach the parents that their role is far greater than just dropping a child offand picking them up. Dr. Lewis teaches that parents must model for theirchildren the expectations and design thinking principles that we aretransferring to them. To tha\\nt end, computer programs and computer literacy helpare available to the parents; informative and interactive workshops areconducted to give parent\\ns hands on, experience in design thinking models. Oneof Dr. Lewis’ most used quotes in the Parents as Partners meetings is ‘You knowthis comes from a good place.’ His advice, direction, teaching, and lifecoaching for parents truly does come from a good place. A place that wants theparents to succeed as much as the kids. A place that knows that investing intomorrow’s leaders begins with cultivating the resources available today. Aplace that knows that it is easier to a\\nccomplish a goal alone but more effectiveto work at bringing along the community to sustain the work after the goal ismet.”\\nAn accomplishedurban educator, Dr. Lewis came to Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School priorto its opening in September 2012 from Teach for America – Detroit, where he wasmost recently a manager of Teacher Leadership Development; during that time, hewas also a visiting instructor at the University of Michigan and a contractedStudent Services Specialist with the Lansing (MI) School District. He earnedhis Bachelor’s degree in Elementary education and Master’s degree in Curriculumand Instruction from Michigan State University. He was a 5th grade teacher,middle school math teacher, and an alternative education teacher at thesecondary level. After seven years of teaching, he returned to school to obtainhis Ph.D. from Michigan State University.\\nDuring his time as a graduatestudent, Dr. Lewis taught classes at Michigan State University, coordinated anintervention program for first time youth offenders, and was director of amentoring program for young males of color.\\nAboutHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School\\nMichigan Chronicle 40 Under 40\\nPublic SchoolAcademies of Detroit’s Henry FordAcademy: Elementary School prepares students in grades K-5 to read, write,and do math at or above grade level, engages all students through project-basedlearning, equip students with design thinking as a process for innovation andcreativity, and provides a\\nstrong foundation in art and design.

These 20 teams will present the prototypes theyhave developed to potentially change the world of an adult, child, or pet.\\nThe educational program for the 390 students at Henry FordAcademy: Elementary School follows the requirements of the Michigan CurriculumFramework. In addition, they learn the processes and ways that “DesignThinkers” approach problems through four\\nchallenges each year.

Teachers facilitated a designthinking challenge with the parents that put students at the center of theintended experience. They helped parents “ideate” a celebratory event and essaycontest that would engage and empower their children and continue Dr. King’slegacy of social change through spoken word.\\nTheschool community came together to implement the plan and make the event areality. Parents worked with social studies teachers to identify grade-levelspecific essay topics. The school’s two art teachers worked with the studentsto create powerful self-portraits. Participants in Mentoring Through Music, anafter-school club for boys, prepared a rap performance. Parents and teacherssupported students as they developed essays that provided a clear vision of howthey would use their voices to effect social change. \\nWhenthe day of the celebration arrived, it proved to be a joyful expression ofstudents’ voices for change through spoken word, artwork, and music. There wasa silent reverence as the school community viewed Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream”speech together. Top essayists in each grade were invited to read their work atthe event, while the top three in each grade received an award.\\nHaylynSanders, 4th grade, shared her ideas for community collaboration and detailed aletter writing effort to all levels of government that would move the readersand effect social change.\\nMeanwhile,Khyaire Smith, 1st grade, took a more introspective approach, “I make sure thatI am the best student that I can be by being a leader and not a follower. Beinga leader in school is the beginning of being a voice for change. I can make achange in the community if I am a leader and believe in myself.”\\nTheplanning process was time consuming, but Henry Ford Academy: Elementary Schoolprincipal Seth N.

While we were not sure that this threat was directed at us, Henry Ford Academy:  School for Creative Studies High School, we closed both the Elementary School and the Middle/High School in an effort to take every precaution to ensure the safety of everyone at our sites.  The threat was vague and did not seem credible.  Several other schools in Detroit and the suburbs received similar threats. \\nBecause there is nothing more important than the safety of our students and staff, we immediately contacted the Detroit Police Department and the security office in the Taubman Center and have worked closely with both to fully investigate our situation.  Our school has been thoroughly searched, and no evidence of any weapons were found.\\nClasses will resume on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at the usual time.  As an additional precautionary measure, police will have an increased presence in and around our school.  School staff will also be available should students have questions or need assistance.\\nWe are extremely pleased that our students felt comfortable enough with school staff to immediately bring this information to our attention and we thank them for their prompt action.  Please encourage your child to always let a teacher or administrator know of any situation that threatens to endanger anyone in our school community.\\nWe are continuing to work on identifying the individual who posted this threat.  If you learn anything related to this situation, please contact the Detroit Police Department immediately.  In the meantime, thank you to everyone who provided us with the information that allowed us to make timely decisions and ensure the safety of our school community.\\nWe look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow morning.\\nSincerely,\\nNan Gill\\nSuperintendent\\nHenry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies\\nComments\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/schoolclosedtoday-dec13', 'False', '1', ' \\nDec 13, 2017, 3:34 AM by Lisa Kreinbring                                        \\xa0                      \\n                        [          updated \\nDec 13, 2017, 5:26 PM]                      \\nDue to the inclement weather expected throughout the day, Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School is closed today - Wednesday, December 13th, 2017.\\xa0\\nComments\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/sciencenight', 'False', '1', ' \\nApr 1, 2016, 9:15 AM by Jeff Mesch                                  \\nHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School and The Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan presents Science Night Live!

Each class cohort, grades K-5,selected a team of innovative thinkers to represent their learning studioduring this special evening. These 20 teams presented the prototypes they developedto potentially change the world of an adult, child, or pet. \\nThe educational program for the 390 studentsat Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School follows the requirements of the MichiganCurriculum Framework. In addition, they learn the processes and ways that“Design Thinkers” approach problems through four\\n challenges each year. These activities differ by grade-level and givestudents the opportunity to innovate solutions to real-life human problemswhile at the same time applying concepts and skills from other disciplines, suchas language arts, math, science, and social studies. \\nTheylearn a specific way to understand and solve those problems.\\n“In our Design Thinking Challenge, we went on a field trip tothe Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the SecondBaptist Church. We interviewed our user and some of the people who work inthose places. What they said helped us make our prototype,” said Henry FordAcademy: Elementary School fourth grader Amaurion Moore, whose team waschallenged to develop a possible way for families to take advantage of thecultural resources of Detroit. “My group worked together to develop the idea ofa Detroit History Scanner. Our user, a male college student, can put his handon the scanner, press start, and the screen tells him at least three of his ancestorswho helped Detroit. It can help you learn your heritage. I think our DesignThinking Challenges help me learn business and social skills.”\\n“Through ourquarterly Design Thinking Challenges, Henry Ford Academy: Elementary Schoolstudents have the opportunity to collaborate, apply what they’ve learned incore subjects, and generate thoughtful ways they can improve the world aroundthem. As a result, they feel like they are valuable members of theircommunities and that their opinions, thoughts, and ideas matter,” said CurtisLewis, Ph.D., Principal of Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School. “We see DesignThinking not as an add-on, but rather an integral process for cultivatingskills like perseverance, endurance, and grit, which are expectations of theCommon Core, but even more importantly, essential skills to be successful inlife.” \\nThe CEO of IDEO, one organization responsible for the growing popularity ofDesign Thinking, has said that Design Thinking might just be the quintessentialcareer and college skill set for this new era, central to success in everycareer. Henry Ford Learning Institute (\\nHFLI\\n), which developed andmanages the school, has worked with the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design atStanford University (“the d.school”), to refine the Design Thinking process foruse with teachers and students in K-12 schools.\\nHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School, \\nhoused in the historic Duane DotyElementary School building, \\n\\xa0is part of theThompson Educational Foundation’s more than $130 million investment in PublicSchool Academies of Detroit (PSAD), which is serving more than 4,400 studentsduring the 2013-2014 school year.

If you want your child to eat breakfast at school, he/she must arrive by 8:00 am. Breakfast ends at 8:20 am. Students who arrive before 8:20 and are not participating in the breakfast program must report to the gym. A student who arrives after 8:30 am is late and will be required to fill out a late slip before reporting to class.\\nThanks for your continued patience as we work to fine tune the dismissal process. Effective immediately, students who are not participating in after school latchkey will line up by grade in the parking lot at dismissal. Parents can: 1) pull up to the exit section of the parking lot, remain in their cars, and have staff radio for their children or 2) legally park, walk up to their children in line and retrieve them. Students WILL NOT be permitted to leave their class in line to run to a parent/car. In the event of inclement weather, students will line up in the Gymnasium. If you would like to volunteer to help with dismissal, please call Dr. Lewis at 313-826-1159.\\nThere is no parking on the south side of Glynn (facing Woodward) at anytime and law enforcement will begin issuing tickets next week.\\xa0\\nImportant Dates:\\nMonday, Sept. 17 -\\xa0 MAP Testing Starts.

Teachers facilitated a design thinking challenge with the parents that put students at the center of the intended experience. They helped parents “ideate” a celebratory event and essay contest that would engage and empower their children and continue Dr. King’s legacy of social change through spoken word.\\nThe school community came together to implement the plan and make the event a reality. Parents worked with social studies teachers to identify grade-level specific essay topics. The school’s two art teachers worked with the students to create powerful self-portraits. Participants in Mentoring Through Music, an after-school club for boys, prepared a rap performance. Parents and teachers supported students as they developed essays that provided a clear vision of how they would use their voices to effect social change.\\nWhen the day of the celebration arrived, it proved to be a joyful expression of students’ voices for change through spoken word, artwork, and music. There was a silent reverence as the school community viewed Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech together. Top essayists in each grade were invited to read their work at the event, while the top three in each grade received an award.\\nHaylyn S., 4th grade, shared her ideas for community collaboration and detailed a letter writing effort to all levels of government that would move the readers and effect social change.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, Khyaire S., 1st grade, took a more introspective approach, “I make sure that I am the best student that I can be by being a leader and not a follower. Being a leader in school is the beginning of being a voice for change. I can make a change in the community if I am a leader and believe in myself.”\\xa0\\nThe planning process was time consuming, school leaders \\xa0think it was well worth the investment and marvel at the dedication of the school’s parent group.\\n“By using the same creative problem solving process our children use, we did it the ‘HFA Way’,” says Dr. Elyse. “Our students do have a voice, and they can make a difference. We are so pleased with the way we were able to come together to honor Dr. King’s legacy.”\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/our-home', 'False', '1', '\\nHFA: Elementary School will be located at the newly renovated Duane Doty Elementary School in Detroit’s Northend community (10225 3rd St, Detroit, MI 48202).

We believe that education is truly about experiencing the world all around and teaching students to apply their knowledge to develop creative solutions to real-world problems.\\nHow is the academic calendar structured?\\xa0The school year runs from September to late June with appropriate vacations, including a mid-winter break. It aligns with the Wayne County Common Calendar. Additionally, there are half days scheduled periodically throughout the school year – on Wednesdays – for teacher professional development sessions. These sessions are designed to provide staff with more frequent opportunities to work together in reviewing student learning progress and making plans to adjust teaching to better serve your children. This is a very common practice in high performing schools and one that we feel will help us reach our goals.\\nWhat is a school day like?\\xa0The school day begins at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 3:40 p.m., Monday through Friday. Early release days end at 1:30 p.m. All students receive instruction in Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies. Multiple times each week they experience Physical Education and Art & Design classes. Morning Meeting and recess are important daily experiences. Latchkey is available before and after school.\\nWhat are class sizes? Small class sizes are important to student learning. In grades K-1, the targeted average class size is 16:1. In grades 2-5, the targeted average class size is 21:1.\\nWhere do students eat lunch? Students eat in our dining hall. HFA: Elementary School participates in the National School Lunch Program and provides eligible students with free/reduced-price breakfasts and lunches.\\nDo you offer after school programs?\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur after school activities include AcademicGames, yoga and health and wellness (provided by our partner, Central DetroitChristian CDC), Cheerleading, Dance Team, Girl Scouts, and Boy Scouts (of Southeast MI)\\xa0\\nand competitive soccer (provided in partnershipwith the Mayor’s office and Detroit PAL - GOAL Detroit).\\nQuestions? Contact Staci Williams, Manager of Community Engagement, at 313-414-9950 or swilliams@hfli.org.\\nHow can I be sure that HFA: Elementary School is a quality school? \\xa0HFA: Elementary School is developed and managed by Henry Ford Learning Institute (HFLI), a non-profit organization that offers highly regarded and innovative educational programs developed in partnership with other exemplary educational institutions. Families can be assured that the curriculum meets all state guidelines and national standards. Every instructor is highly qualified and holds a valid State of Michigan teaching certificate as a requirement of employment. We also have the support of corporate and community partners who, along with our parents, hold us to a high level of achievement. Our school district was designated by P21 as a 2015-2016 National 21st Century Learning Exemplar for our innovative teaching and learning practices; the HFA: SCS K-12 district is the first P21 Exemplar in Michigan.\\xa0\\nWhat is the connection to Henry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies?\\xa0\\nStudents who complete 5th grade at HFA: Elementary School will automatically be enrolled as 6th graders at \\nHenry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies\\n (HFA: SCS), a public charter middle/high school serving grades 6 through 12. HFA: SCS is a Thompson Foundation 90/90 school, committed to graduating 90% of its students and sending at least 90% of those graduates on to college. HFA: SCS is located in the A. Alfred Taubman Center for Design Education at 485 W. Milwaukee St., Detroit. Both schools are located in Detroit's Northend neighborhood.\\nWhat is an enrollment lottery?\\xa0If there are more applications submitted by the deadline date (April 7, 2017) than available seats for a particular grade, HFA: Elementary School will hold a random selection lottery on April 14, 2017. All lottery applications will be drawn and placed on either the acceptance list or the waiting list for each grade based on the number they receive in the lottery. Please contact us at the number below with any questions.\\nWhat happens if my student’s name is added to the waitlist at the lottery?\\xa0Students on the acceptance list have until the enrollment date to accept their spot at our school for the 2017-2018 school year.  If a student does not accept that seat by that date, HFA: Elementary School will offer that seat to the next eligible person on the waitlist.\\nWhat are the chances that both of my children will be admitted?\\xa0Each child must meet the eligibility requirements (lives in the State of Michigan, is of appropriate age for the selected grade and has formal records to indicate they are prepared to enter the selected grade), must complete the application for enrollment form and submit that form prior to the enrollment deadline (April 28, 2017). If one child’s application is selected during the random lottery, both students will automatically be offered an enrollment seat. Please note that families are not eligible for the automatic sibling preference for enrollment if they do not submit individual applications for each student and/or do not fill out the sibling statement on the application.\\nIs there a school uniform?\\xa0Yes. Like many other schools of choice, our students wear solid color shirts with a school logo and navy or black pants or skirts. A hoodie and a fleece with the school logo are also available for chilly days.\\nWhat about transportation?\\xa0Like many schools, HFA: Elementary School does not provide free bus service.\\nUpdated 03/6/2017\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites\"), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/how-to-attend/information-sessions', 'False', '1', '\\nPlease join Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School for \\nan Open House!\\xa0\\nLearn about our K-5 school,\\xa0meet our teachers and staff, see our beautiful facility and apply for the 2018-2019 school year.\\nWhen:\\nFebruary 7, 2018 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nMarch 7, 2018 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nMarch 21st\\n\\xa0 from\\xa0\\n4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nApril 11, 2018 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nApril 18th\\nScience Night & Open House from\\xa0\\n4:30pm to 5:30pm\\nMay 9, 2018 from 4:30 to 5:30pm\\nWho:\\xa0\\nOpen Houses are for families of new students entering grades K-5. \\xa0\\nKindergarten Kickoff is for families of students entering Kindergarten in Fall 2019 (only).

The decision to close school due to weather conditions, therefore,  is always a difficult one. \\n  With this month’s record snowfalls and extreme low temperatures, we’ve weighed on the side of student and staff safety a number of times, cancelling a scheduled day of instruction. \\n  Who makes the call to close school? It’s not just a single person, but a team comprised of your school principals, Acting Superintendent Nan Gill, HFLI Executive Director Deborah Parizek, with support from our facilities and communications team members.  They consider a number of factors when predictions of inclement weather arise: \\n·       The conditions of main roads and side streets and the likelihood they will be cleared; \\n·       Meteorologists’ forecasts (along with a healthy amount of skepticism to avoid any hype); \\n·       The safety of not only those who are driving to school, but our students who walk or take public transportation; and \\n·       The decisions of our colleagues across Metro Detroit, including other PSAD schools and at Detroit Public Schools. \\n  Why do we take other school closings into consideration? It’s our experience that attendance at our schools is lower when the surrounding public school system is closed. When our attendance is below 75% on a given day, the state can take away a day’s funding. \\n  Also factored into the decision is the state’s limit of six snow days; we may have to make up the days in the summer or cut other scheduled breaks short if we go past that number. \\n We do our very best to make a call to cancel school the night before a school closing, so our families and staff can make any necessary adjustments to their daily plans. We post notifications to our Facebook pages and web sites, and through the consolidated school closing reporting system which pushes our notifications out to local media outlets. We also activate our SchoolReach system to call our families and staff directly. \\n  In the event we don’t have enough conclusive information during evening hours, and we do have to make a decision in the morning, we do our best to any announcements by 6:00 a.m. through the same notification process to families, staff and the public. \\n  We hope this information is helpful in understanding our decisions to keep our schools open, or to close, during inclement weather. \\n  In the meantime, please know that the education and safety of your child is our top priority -- and please join us in hopeful thoughts of warm sunshine, budding trees, and clear roads.  \\nDr. Curtis Lewis \\nFounding Principal \\nHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School \\nRashid Faisal \\nPrincipal \\nHenry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies\\nComments\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/annualeducationreportsaernowavailable', 'False', '1', ' \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:51 AM by Lisa Kreinbring                                        \\xa0                      \\n                        [          updated \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:52 AM]                      \\nWe are pleased to present school and district-level Annual Education Reports (AER) and cover letters which provide key information on the 2012-2013 educational progress for Henry Ford Academy Elementary School and its school district.\\nČ\\nUpdating...\\nĊ\\nDistrict AER Cover and Report 2012-2013.pdf\\n(252k)\\nLisa Kreinbring, \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:51 AM\\nv.1\\nď\\nĊ\\nHFAES School AER Cover and Report 2012-2013.pdf\\n(222k)\\nLisa Kreinbring, \\nAug 20, 2013, 10:51 AM\\nv.1\\nď\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/april2015newsletter', 'False', '1', ' \\nApr 3, 2015, 4:32 PM by tjubert@hfaes.org                                        \\xa0                      \\n                        [          updated \\nApr 3, 2015, 4:34 PM]                      \\nGreetings HFA: Elementary School families.

Dr. Lewis received hisaward during a celebration at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African AmericanHistory on Friday, Octobe\\nr 25, 2013.\\nIn her nomination, Henry Ford Academy: Elementary Schoolparent Dr. Kimberly Elyse wrote at length about his impact not only on theschool’s students, but als\\no their parents:\\n“\\nDr. Lewis takes time toteach the parents that their role is far greater than just dropping a child offand picking them up. Dr. Lewis teaches that parents must model for theirchildren the expectations and design thinking principles that we aretransferring to them. To tha\\nt end, computer programs and computer literacy helpare available to the parents; informative and interactive workshops areconducted to give parent\\ns hands on, experience in design thinking models. Oneof Dr. Lewis’ most used quotes in the Parents as Partners meetings is ‘You knowthis comes from a good place.’ His advice, direction, teaching, and lifecoaching for parents truly does come from a good place. A place that wants theparents to succeed as much as the kids. A place that knows that investing intomorrow’s leaders begins with cultivating the resources available today. Aplace that knows that it is easier to a\\nccomplish a goal alone but more effectiveto work at bringing along the community to sustain the work after the goal ismet.”\\nAn accomplishedurban educator, Dr. Lewis came to Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School priorto its opening in September 2012 from Teach for America – Detroit, where he wasmost recently a manager of Teacher Leadership Development; during that time, hewas also a visiting instructor at the University of Michigan and a contractedStudent Services Specialist with the Lansing (MI) School District. He earnedhis Bachelor’s degree in Elementary education and Master’s degree in Curriculumand Instruction from Michigan State University. He was a 5th grade teacher,middle school math teacher, and an alternative education teacher at thesecondary level. After seven years of teaching, he returned to school to obtainhis Ph.D. from Michigan State University.\\nDuring his time as a graduatestudent, Dr. Lewis taught classes at Michigan State University, coordinated anintervention program for first time youth offenders, and was director of amentoring program for young males of color.\\nAboutHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School\\nMichigan Chronicle 40 Under 40\\nPublic SchoolAcademies of Detroit’s Henry FordAcademy: Elementary School prepares students in grades K-5 to read, write,and do math at or above grade level, engages all students through project-basedlearning, equip students with design thinking as a process for innovation andcreativity, and provides a\\nstrong foundation in art and design.

These 20 teams will present the prototypes theyhave developed to potentially change the world of an adult, child, or pet.\\nThe educational program for the 390 students at Henry FordAcademy: Elementary School follows the requirements of the Michigan CurriculumFramework. In addition, they learn the processes and ways that “DesignThinkers” approach problems through four\\nchallenges each year. These activities differ by grade level and give studentsthe opportunity to innovate solutions to real-life human problems while at thesame time applying concepts and skills from other disciplines, such as languagearts, math, science, and social studies. \\nThey learn a specific way tounderstand and solve those problems. This quarter, students tackled a range ofproblems, including \\nways that peers can keeptoys organized or ways to keep a “middle schooler” entertained during a 3-4 daypower outage. \\nThe CEO of IDEO, one organization responsible for the growingpopularity of Design Thinking, has said that Design Thinking might just be thequintessential career and college skill set for this new era, central tosuccess in every career. Henry Ford Learning Institute (HFLI), which developedand manages the school, has worked with the Hasso Plattner Institute of Designat Stanford University (“the d.school”), to refine the Design Thinking processfor use with teachers and students in K-12 schools.\\nWHAT:\\n \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 HenryFord Academy: Elementary School’s Design Thinking Expo\\nWHO:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Students, Teachers, Staff, Familiesand Community Partners\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Curtis Lewis, Ph.D., Founding Principal, Henry Ford Academy: ElementarySchool\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\nWHEN:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tuesday,March 4, 2014, 6:00 – 7:30 p.m.\\nWHERE:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 10225Third Street, in Detroit’s greater Boston-Edison area\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Televisionlive truck parking available at Glynn Ct. entrance \\nRSVP:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Media, pleasecontact Lisa Kreinbring, HFLI Communications, if you plan to attend\\nHenry Ford Academy:Elementary School is part of the Thompson Foundation’s more than $130 millioninvestment in Public School Academies of Detroit (PSAD), which is serving morethan 4,400 students during the 2013-2014 school year.

Teachers facilitated a designthinking challenge with the parents that put students at the center of theintended experience. They helped parents “ideate” a celebratory event and essaycontest that would engage and empower their children and continue Dr. King’slegacy of social change through spoken word.\\nTheschool community came together to implement the plan and make the event areality. Parents worked with social studies teachers to identify grade-levelspecific essay topics. The school’s two art teachers worked with the studentsto create powerful self-portraits. Participants in Mentoring Through Music, anafter-school club for boys, prepared a rap performance. Parents and teacherssupported students as they developed essays that provided a clear vision of howthey would use their voices to effect social change. \\nWhenthe day of the celebration arrived, it proved to be a joyful expression ofstudents’ voices for change through spoken word, artwork, and music. There wasa silent reverence as the school community viewed Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream”speech together. Top essayists in each grade were invited to read their work atthe event, while the top three in each grade received an award.\\nHaylynSanders, 4th grade, shared her ideas for community collaboration and detailed aletter writing effort to all levels of government that would move the readersand effect social change.\\nMeanwhile,Khyaire Smith, 1st grade, took a more introspective approach, “I make sure thatI am the best student that I can be by being a leader and not a follower. Beinga leader in school is the beginning of being a voice for change.

While we were not sure that this threat was directed at us, Henry Ford Academy:  School for Creative Studies High School, we closed both the Elementary School and the Middle/High School in an effort to take every precaution to ensure the safety of everyone at our sites.  The threat was vague and did not seem credible.  Several other schools in Detroit and the suburbs received similar threats. \\nBecause there is nothing more important than the safety of our students and staff, we immediately contacted the Detroit Police Department and the security office in the Taubman Center and have worked closely with both to fully investigate our situation.  Our school has been thoroughly searched, and no evidence of any weapons were found.\\nClasses will resume on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at the usual time.  As an additional precautionary measure, police will have an increased presence in and around our school.  School staff will also be available should students have questions or need assistance.\\nWe are extremely pleased that our students felt comfortable enough with school staff to immediately bring this information to our attention and we thank them for their prompt action.  Please encourage your child to always let a teacher or administrator know of any situation that threatens to endanger anyone in our school community.\\nWe are continuing to work on identifying the individual who posted this threat.  If you learn anything related to this situation, please contact the Detroit Police Department immediately.  In the meantime, thank you to everyone who provided us with the information that allowed us to make timely decisions and ensure the safety of our school community.\\nWe look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow morning.\\nSincerely,\\nNan Gill\\nSuperintendent\\nHenry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies\\nComments\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/schoolclosedtoday-dec13', 'False', '1', ' \\nDec 13, 2017, 3:34 AM by Lisa Kreinbring                                        \\xa0                      \\n                        [          updated \\nDec 13, 2017, 5:26 PM]                      \\nDue to the inclement weather expected throughout the day, Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School is closed today - Wednesday, December 13th, 2017.\\xa0\\nComments\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/news/sciencenight', 'False', '1', ' \\nApr 1, 2016, 9:15 AM by Jeff Mesch                                  \\nHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School and The Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan presents Science Night Live!

Each class cohort, grades K-5,selected a team of innovative thinkers to represent their learning studioduring this special evening. These 20 teams presented the prototypes they developedto potentially change the world of an adult, child, or pet. \\nThe educational program for the 390 studentsat Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School follows the requirements of the MichiganCurriculum Framework. In addition, they learn the processes and ways that“Design Thinkers” approach problems through four\\n challenges each year. These activities differ by grade-level and givestudents the opportunity to innovate solutions to real-life human problemswhile at the same time applying concepts and skills from other disciplines, suchas language arts, math, science, and social studies. \\nTheylearn a specific way to understand and solve those problems.\\n“In our Design Thinking Challenge, we went on a field trip tothe Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the SecondBaptist Church. We interviewed our user and some of the people who work inthose places. What they said helped us make our prototype,” said Henry FordAcademy: Elementary School fourth grader Amaurion Moore, whose team waschallenged to develop a possible way for families to take advantage of thecultural resources of Detroit. “My group worked together to develop the idea ofa Detroit History Scanner. Our user, a male college student, can put his handon the scanner, press start, and the screen tells him at least three of his ancestorswho helped Detroit. It can help you learn your heritage. I think our DesignThinking Challenges help me learn business and social skills.”\\n“Through ourquarterly Design Thinking Challenges, Henry Ford Academy: Elementary Schoolstudents have the opportunity to collaborate, apply what they’ve learned incore subjects, and generate thoughtful ways they can improve the world aroundthem. As a result, they feel like they are valuable members of theircommunities and that their opinions, thoughts, and ideas matter,” said CurtisLewis, Ph.D., Principal of Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School. “We see DesignThinking not as an add-on, but rather an integral process for cultivatingskills like perseverance, endurance, and grit, which are expectations of theCommon Core, but even more importantly, essential skills to be successful inlife.” \\nThe CEO of IDEO, one organization responsible for the growing popularity ofDesign Thinking, has said that Design Thinking might just be the quintessentialcareer and college skill set for this new era, central to success in everycareer. Henry Ford Learning Institute (\\nHFLI\\n), which developed andmanages the school, has worked with the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design atStanford University (“the d.school”), to refine the Design Thinking process foruse with teachers and students in K-12 schools.\\nHenry Ford Academy: Elementary School, \\nhoused in the historic Duane DotyElementary School building, \\n\\xa0is part of theThompson Educational Foundation’s more than $130 million investment in PublicSchool Academies of Detroit (PSAD), which is serving more than 4,400 studentsduring the 2013-2014 school year.

Students who arrive before 8:20 and are not participating in the breakfast program must report to the gym. A student who arrives after 8:30 am is late and will be required to fill out a late slip before reporting to class.\\nThanks for your continued patience as we work to fine tune the dismissal process. Effective immediately, students who are not participating in after school latchkey will line up by grade in the parking lot at dismissal. Parents can: 1) pull up to the exit section of the parking lot, remain in their cars, and have staff radio for their children or 2) legally park, walk up to their children in line and retrieve them. Students WILL NOT be permitted to leave their class in line to run to a parent/car. In the event of inclement weather, students will line up in the Gymnasium. If you would like to volunteer to help with dismissal, please call Dr. Lewis at 313-826-1159.\\nThere is no parking on the south side of Glynn (facing Woodward) at anytime and law enforcement will begin issuing tickets next week.\\xa0\\nImportant Dates:\\nMonday, Sept. 17 -\\xa0 MAP Testing Starts.

Teachers facilitated a design thinking challenge with the parents that put students at the center of the intended experience. They helped parents “ideate” a celebratory event and essay contest that would engage and empower their children and continue Dr. King’s legacy of social change through spoken word.\\nThe school community came together to implement the plan and make the event a reality. Parents worked with social studies teachers to identify grade-level specific essay topics. The school’s two art teachers worked with the students to create powerful self-portraits. Participants in Mentoring Through Music, an after-school club for boys, prepared a rap performance. Parents and teachers supported students as they developed essays that provided a clear vision of how they would use their voices to effect social change.\\nWhen the day of the celebration arrived, it proved to be a joyful expression of students’ voices for change through spoken word, artwork, and music. There was a silent reverence as the school community viewed Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech together. Top essayists in each grade were invited to read their work at the event, while the top three in each grade received an award.\\nHaylyn S., 4th grade, shared her ideas for community collaboration and detailed a letter writing effort to all levels of government that would move the readers and effect social change.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, Khyaire S., 1st grade, took a more introspective approach, “I make sure that I am the best student that I can be by being a leader and not a follower. Being a leader in school is the beginning of being a voice for change. I can make a change in the community if I am a leader and believe in myself.”\\xa0\\nThe planning process was time consuming, school leaders \\xa0think it was well worth the investment and marvel at the dedication of the school’s parent group.\\n“By using the same creative problem solving process our children use, we did it the ‘HFA Way’,” says Dr. Elyse. “Our students do have a voice, and they can make a difference. We are so pleased with the way we were able to come together to honor Dr. King’s legacy.”\\nSign in\\n|\\nReport Abuse\\n|\\nPowered By \\nGoogle Sites'), ('http://hfaes.hfli.org/our-home', 'False', '1', '\\nHFA: Elementary School will be located at the newly renovated Duane Doty Elementary School in Detroit’s Northend community (10225 3rd St, Detroit, MI 48202).
