We’re proud of our district and hope you are as well!\\nGetaways on a Budget\\nGetting away from the everyday hustle and bustle can be wonderful. Unfortunately, many families are financially strapped and never take that much-needed weekend getaway. With so many discount and coupon websites available, however, a weekend trip with the family is much cheaper than you might think!\\nHere are a few pointers to help you find the best deals for your family excursion…\\nLocation:\\nChoose a location you can drive to. For a weekend trip, you want to maximize the time at your chosen destination, so keeping your drive-time to four hours or less is recommended. Draw a four-hour radius around your hometown, and decide which city within that circle would be the most fun for your family to visit. The larger the city, the more activities and discounts you will find.\\nHotel:\\nWebsites like \\nHotwire.com\\n will give you a list of hotels within the vicinity of where you’re going. Decide on the price you’re willing to spend on a room, and choose the highest rated hotel within your price range. You’ll be surprised at the low rates you can find for high-quality hotels!\\nTripAdvisor\\n can be helpful in your hotel search, too. Not only does it provide reviews on hotels within your price range, but it also provides key information about parking, nearby attractions, and even available discounts. Once you’ve found a hotel, bed and breakfast, or other lodging option, \\nTripAdvisor\\n will search multiple discount sites simultaneously and help you get the best value for your money.\\nActivities:\\nWhat you do on your getaway can make or break the trip. To maximize your spending cash, subscribe to discount sites like \\nGroupon\\n or \\nLivingSocial\\n, and watch for entertainment deals in your destination city. These deals can range anywhere from paintball and laser tag to local water parks, spas, and restaurants. By arranging activities through these discount sites, you are guaranteed to save at least 50% off the retail value for your excursion.\\nSearching your destination city’s Convention and Visitor’s Bureau (CVB) website is another great way to save on entertainment. These sites often have links to coupons and discounts. Check out the \\nKansas City CVB\\n for an example.\\nLastly, let \\nGoogle\\n do the work for you. Search “coupons for (your destination),” and see all the wonderful sites that come up!\\nIn short, the key is to take the time to plan and research your trip. By following the above guidelines, you will find deals you didn’t even know were available. Plus, with all of the cash you save, you’ll already be well on your way to saving for your next getaway!\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",

Fuller in 2001. AIA is an open enrollment charter school serving Houston and Lancaster. AIA gives students the benefits of a private school education free of charge.\\nAIA does all it can to make sure that each child learns. By providing built-in extended day hours, children have the opportunity to get extra help if they need it. AIA also offers Saturday tutorials for students who need one-on-one tutoring help.\\r\\nWhat is a Charter School?\\nA charter school is a nonsectarian public school of choice that operates with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. The \"charter\" establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school\\'s mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success.\\nThe length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3-5 years. At the end of the term, the entity granting the charter may renew the school\\'s contract. Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor–usually a state or local school board–to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract.\\nThe basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups: the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",

If summer school was required, the student must pass the math and reading released STAAR test. If a student does not pass the appropriate test, he/she must enroll in the retained grade as stated on the official/final report card.\\nStudents seeking enrollment who were not in attendance 90 percent or more of the school days of the prior school year must take and pass an AIA STAAR Released Test/Grade Placement Test in order for us to consider them for promotion at AIA.\\nWe require students who fail STAAR and go to summer school at a campus other than AIA, to pass an AIA STAAR Release Test in order for us to promote them. Otherwise, we will admit them into the same grade as the prior school year.\\nWe will monitor the student and evaluate his/her progress for the first six weeks of school. He/She must have satisfactory scores on the following:\\nPassing grades in all core subjects on report card\\n70% or above on benchmark tests\\nDiscipline history\\n\\rIf the student meets all of the above mentioned requirements, we will promote him/her to the next grade level.\\nStudents enrolling from private schools must have satisfactory scores on the Stanford 10, ITBS, etc. that are equivalent to passing scores on the STAAR test. If not, the student will follow the outlined requirements above.\\nAIA wishes to enroll all deserving students who will benefit from its educational program. Therefore, AIA reserves the right to deny student admission for the following reasons:\\nExtensive and documented discipline violations\\nPrior adjudication\\nMaximum capacity reached at student’s grade level\\nIf we find that a student enrolls with falsified records and/or withheld discipline history, we will immediately withdraw him/her from school.\\nIf the school admits a student and finds out later that the student did not pass STAAR or STAAR Released Test in summer school, we will place the student in his/her last grade completed.\\xa0\\nIn its admissions policies and procedures, AIA does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual preference, or national/ethnic origin. It maintains a “waiting pool” and conducts a lottery when there are more student applicants than classroom vacancies. Once we determine that a child may be admitted to AIA, a family may complete the enrollment process.\\nRe-enrollment\\nPer our admission policy, all returning students must have a completed re-enrollment packet on file by the last day of February. Re-enrollment for new students will begin on January 15.\\nForms and Information\\nApplication for Admissions\\xa0\\nEnrollment Forms\\nFree/Reduced Meal Application\\nParent and Student Handbook\\xa0\\nRe-Enrollment Application\\xa0\\nStart-Up School Supply List\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCopyright ©2018\\xa0| Site designed and maintained by \\nSchool Webmasters'),\n",

Butterfield (attributed)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAugust 25, 2017\\nDear 7th Grade Students and Parents,\\nI have five announcements.\\n(1)\\xa0\\nPast Quiz:\\xa0As some of you know, I\\'ve posted the grades for the geography quiz. Some students were very prepared and got 100s whereas others performed poorly. There will be an opportunity for students to increase their quiz scores, and some of the 25 terms that were on the quiz will be on a future test, so there will be an opportunity for redemption. Furthermore, I will post the shorter version of the Quizlet once all of the students have taken the quiz.\\n(2)\\xa0\\nFuture Quiz:\\xa0I was planning on giving a quiz next week on Native Americans, but Hurricane Harvey may delay it. Please see the Chapter 3 Assessment on pp. 96-97; I will get most of my questions from the content on these pages, so be sure to study them well.\\n(3)\\xa0\\nLate Homework Policy:\\xa0Aristoi Classical Academy has a no late homework policy. In other words, students who do not turn in their homework on time will receive a 0 for the assignment.\\n(4)\\xa0\\nFuture Test:\\xa0There will be a test in the next two to three weeks on geography terms, the four regions of Texas, and Native Americans. Students will want to be sure to review these topics in detail in preparation for the test.\\n(5)\\xa0\\n1st Quarter Project:\\xa0I will be posting the details of the first quarter project in the next few weeks; stay tuned.\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Above all, please stay safe during the hurricane.\\nBest,\\nMr. Vallery\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAugust 16, 2017\\nDear 7th Grade History Students,\\nPlease see the \\nGeographic Dictionary\\xa0Quizlet Link\\n\\xa0that I\\'ve prepared for you. Happy studying!\\nBest,\\nMr. Vallery\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSeptember 5, 2017\\nDear 7th Grade History Students and Parents,\\nPlease see the following important information:\\nToday\\'s Material\\nTo see some of today\\'s material for Christopher Columbus, please click on this \\nlink\\n. Note that there is a video that plays automatically; please turn down the volume on your computer or device before you look at the material. Parents, I encourage you to look at this with your child. I have not seen the videos, so I cannot vouch for the content on them.\\nAssignment to Redeem Quiz Grade: Geography Glossary\\nMake a geography glossary with all the terms you missed, plus however many additional terms it takes to get you to a multiple of 5. For example, if you missed 7 questions, you would make a glossary with 10 terms.\\nExemption: If you received an A, you do not have to do this assignment but may if you so choose. For all others, this is mandatory.

I realize that you may not have all of the tests and quizzes. For this reason, I am going to post a set of quizzes and tests for you to practice for the final. The final consists of questions taken from these quizzes and tests. You should focus on the following:\\n*Fahrenheit 451\\n*Poetry (not terms; identifications only)\\n*The Odyssey\\n*To Kill a Mockingbird\\n*Logical fallacies\\nSome students were not here for the first semester. If that is the case, they do not need to study for the first semester (i.e. poetry and\\xa0Fahrenheit 451). The final will consist primarily of multiple choice with fill in the blanks for quote/poetry/author identifications. There are going to be 40 questions on the final. Please let me know if you have any questions. Good luck in your studies!\\nBest,\\nDr. Vallery\\nA week ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJeremiah Vallery\\n0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nTexas and Texans Chapters (For Final Exam)\\nA week ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJeremiah Vallery\\n0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFinal Exam Review\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nDear 7th Grade Students and Parents,\\nPlease see the full Study Guide for the final exam.

If possible, please turn in the lunch form to me tomorrow so that I can pass it on to Mrs. Sarver. I apologize about any inconvenience.\\nThank you,\\nDr. Vallery\\nOver a month ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJeremiah Vallery\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4th Quarter 7th Grade History Project\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nDear Parents and Students,\\nI\\'ve attached the 7th grade history project for the 4th quarter. It is essentially a family history project. Please see the document for details.\\nSome students have said that their parents have expressed unease about the ethnicity portion of the project. Parents, you have the option to opt out of the ethnic background portion. If you are not comfortable sharing ethnic background info, please sign on the dotted line of the sheet that I will prepare for students this week; I will then verify by email that you want to opt out.\\nAlso, some parents have gotten a report that I am requiring students to give me their DNA. This is \\nfalse! In fact, I told students specifically not to tell their parents that I want them to take a DNA test. I merely indicated that this was an option that they could do only with their parents\\' permission.\\nHow will your information be shared? I thought it would be interesting to put together the information of the students so that we could get a sense of the ethnic diversity of the 7th grade student body, along with information about where students are from. Your information is going to be on a hard copy that your child will control. I will not collect any personal information; that is, I will collect ethnic background in an anonymous fashion by putting the information of your child into a spreadsheet with no names. After I make the spreadsheet and put together some charts (these will have no names on them), I will print out a copy for all 7th graders to have. I think this would be a great way to celebrate the rich and diverse ethnic and geographical background of our students at Aristoi.\\nSome students have expressed concerns since they are adopted. Adopted students may opt out of the ethnic portion of the project. If they cannot find enough information about their biological family, they should write about their adopted family.\\nIf you have any questions about the project, please let me know.\\nThank you,\\nDr. Vallery\\nOver a month ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nJeremiah Vallery\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nNext ►\\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Jeremiah  Vallery\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\n7th/8th Grade English/History\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHome\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosts\\n©Aristoi Classical Academy\\n5618 Eleventh St.\\nKaty,\\xa0 TX\\xa0 77493\\nPhone:\\xa0 281-391-5003\\nFax: 281-391-5010\\nPowered by Edlio',\n",

He studied Latin extensively in \\nhigh school\\n and in college, along with early English literature, mathematics, physics, and theatre. Rice granted him a B.A. in English, and he later obtained an M.Ed. from \\nLoyola University Maryland\\n. He came to Aristoi Classical Academy in the fall of 2016.\\nMr. Lockett\\xa0has previously taught at \\nThe Kinkaid School\\n, \\nSt. Catherine\\'s Montessori School\\n (as a founding teacher of the Middle School), and \\nThe Post Oak School\\n, where he served as director of communications when not teaching in the middle school or upper elementary. He has also worked as a\\xa0mentor teacher for the English department in Houston\\'s \\nBreakthrough Collaborative\\n program, which offers enrichment classes to under-served middle- and high-school students, along with teaching internships for high-school seniors and university undergraduates. Mr. Lockett volunteers\\xa0with undergraduates of Baker College at Rice University as a community associate —\\xa0including\\xa0thirty years advising, consulting, acting, and directing for their spring Shakespeare production — and has also directed several modern plays\\xa0for the Rice Players.\\nOutside of education, Mr. Lockett has too many hobbies\\xa0to keep up with at the same time. He enjoys attending, acting in, and directing theatre (particularly Shakespeare); early/folk music (listening, singing, and playing the \\nRenaissance recorder\\n or \\nHighland bagpipes\\n); riding his \\nrecumbent bicycle\\n (including three times on the \\nMS 150\\n from Houston to Austin); turning wood on a \\nlathe\\n; soldering small electronics; desktop publishing (in \\nAdobe InDesign\\n) and computer programming (in \\nPython\\n and \\nJavaScript\\n); \\nEuro-style board games\\n or role-playing games (from an \\nextensive collection\\n); reading in science, history, or science fiction; and playing with his beloved \\nBurmese cat\\n, Pirate. Mr. Lockett\\'s wife of fifteen years works for Rice University as a \\nbioinformatics\\n programmer, studying genetic data from various organisms to discover their ecological and evolutionary relationships.\\nRecent Posts\\nAnnus Novus\\nIt\\'s a new school year and, as always, I can feel the excitement bubbling through the air, in both students and faculty. We have a new campus (some parts so new as to be not quite yet in actual existence!), new schedules, new classes, new students and teachers... It\\'s a whirlwind of novelty such that Mr. Bergeron and I still had to consider carefully where to find the faculty work room this morning!\\nYou can hear, too, the usual human responses to change, which typically amount to either awe or angst. Grumbling is par for the course among most adolescents (and, alas, many adults), but you can nevertheless feel and hear, among many, the more positive moods of amazement, thanksgiving, and joy.\\n\"Be joyful\" is one of the short-hand rules for my classroom. \\xa0Many new students comment that they haven\\'t heard such a directive since kindergarten or very early elementary. I mourn a bit when I hear such stories: all too often educators, when confronted with child-like exuberance, squash it in the interest of discipline rather than attempting to channel it into worthwhile expressions and activities. \\xa0A great religious figure once said, \"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\" \\xa0And we find that puckish humor, wide-ranging attention, and cultivation of wonder in many successful scientists, from Albert Einstein to Richard Feynman, and in writers from Shakespeare to Twain.\\n\"I am responsible for the quality of my own education,\" is the first of the Aristoi Core Beliefs posted in every classroom -- and I draw attention to it from every student on the first day. \\xa0Education requires responsibility, and responsibility requires attention. Joy is a great director of attention, both more potent and more pleasant than fear. \\xa0And so I cultivate enthusiasm, and awe, and appreciation, not as sources of distraction and destruction in the classroom, but as keys for the memorization and consolidation of human knowledge, as guidestars to direct us toward the unity of knowledge.\\n\"Student\" comes from the Latin studium, meaning enthusiasm or zeal. \\xa0And though \"discipline\" comes from discipulus, \"student,\" the Latin word for \"school\" is ludus -- which also means \"game.\" \\xa0An unordered riot is not a successful amusement. Games, whether on the field or on the board, require an understanding of and respect for rules, an adult capacity for self-restraint and social behavior, and the ability to identify and learn from mistakes.

This will be my third year of teaching 4th grade.\\xa0\\nMy family has lived in Texas since 2002. Before becoming a teacher, I was a freelance writer and a home-schooling mom. I am married to Dean, a Latin teacher and ancient historian, and we have six children, four of whom are adults.\\xa0 The other two are my daughter, who is a high school senior in Sugar Land, and my son, who is in 8th grade at Aristoi’s Upper School.\\xa0\\nMy approach to education involves a combination of the classical methods with a whole-child Love and Logic philosophy. Partnership between parent and teacher is important to me and I will do my best to keep you well informed of classroom instruction and your student’s progress.

I\\xa0 taught two years in 3rd grade. This is my third year in 5th and I am so thrilled to be a part of the transition of 5th to the upper school on the new campus.\\xa0I have a BS from University of Houston with a Reading specialization. I have taught for over 18 years in public and private school, as well as being a homeschool mom for 8 years. My husband of\\xa030 years and I have raised two beautiful daughters and are enjoying the “empty nest” phase of our lives. Reading, Language Arts and History\\xa0are my passions as a teacher. I love the power of a story.\\xa0Classical literature especially has the power to influence in so many positive ways.\\xa0In \"The Lord of the Rings\", as Frodo and Sam continue on their journey, Sam asks a very important question – “What sort of tale have I fallen into?” He assumes that there is a story; something much larger going on. This year as we read and write and study the written word, it is my goal that the power of the story, the deeper meanings, will grab hold of your student and inspire and motivate them to be “responsible citizens of virtuous character.”\\nPlease check the side bar for important information.\\nClass Syllabus \\nRemind.com information\\nMay\\xa0test Calendar\\nTheater Letter from Ms. W\\nReview Sheets for History and Reading Tests\\nSome important reminders for this week:\\nPlease check planners.

Recently, scientists have been studying the effects of \"awe\" on people. They have found that when feeling awe, a person typically is more generous, others-centered, and thinks with more focus. Aren\\'t these all things we want from our children?! So, this year I began an experiment. Each day, at the beginning of class in the 2nd-4th grades, I show what I call an \"Awe Video\".  The students have been enthralled and look forward to coming to see the next video. And, yes, I have noticed fewer behavior problems in those grades this year. Which means we can all get on with doing and learning music.

The test not only serves as preparation for the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) which is required for admission by most colleges, but is also the qualifying assessment for the National Merit Scholars program. Most high schools provide for the PSAT to be taken by their college-bound students.\\nAccording to The College Board, juniors across the state scored an average of 963 out of 1600 on the test. Meanwhile, Aristoi’s juniors’ average score was 1134, over 150 points above the state average.\\nWith the PSAT and SAT’s heavy emphasis on reasoning, language, and reading comprehension, it is not surprising that a classical education is a difference maker when it comes to this kind of assessment. From kindergarten on, Aristoi students learn grammar, memorize and recite classic speeches and poetry, and read whole books (not just excerpts). Older students study Latin, work through the history and literature of Western Civilization in the 9th through 12th grade “Humane Letters” sequence, and compose and publicly defend a Senior Thesis on a topic of their choosing.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFaculty Employment Opportunities\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOpen teacher positions are now posted.

I have also worked in an educational role with Pre-K and Kindergarten students. I have a B.S. degree from Silver Lake College in Manitowoc, WI. My husband and I are the parents of four precious boys.\\nI am excited to help guide my students to a deeper understanding and appreciation of classics in literature. We will be working together to strengthen writing and spelling skills. Our study of history will bring us to knowing and discussing key events of our past. Persevering through math practice and science study opens our minds to new ideas and truths of our world.

The purpose of art is to produce thinking. The secret is not the mechanics or technical skill that create art - but the process of introspection and different levels of contemplation that generate it. Once you learn to embrace this process, your creative potential is limitless.\\nArtwork should be an active verb (a lens by which to view the world) not a passive noun (a painting that sits dormant in a museum). Creativity lies NOT in the done but in the doing. Art is active and incomplete. Always shifting, always becoming. Art is a sneak peak into the future of potential, of what could be. Not a past result of what has been already done. Art is a process, not a product.\\nArt is a human act. Art is Risky. Generous. Courageous. Provocative. You can be perfect, or you can make art. You can keep track of what you will get in return for your effort, or you can make art. You can enjoy the status quo, or you can make art.\"\\n-Erik Wahl\\n6th Grade Tutoring\\nTimes: Lunch Monday and Wednesday\\nHigh School Open Studio Time\\nTimes: Lunch Wednesday\\nLesson Plans & Homework\\nIf you would like to have a look at my lesson plans for the week, or double check the homework, please follow this link:\\xa0\\nhttps://planbook.com/planbook.html?t=1169298&k=ArtKey\\nIn the 6th grade Art History we have\\xa0\\nweekly homework\\n.

All of the text book chapters, and side shows can be found on the 6th grade art history page, and the videos can be found in the video tab.\\nGood luck,\\nRochelle Kornas\\n5 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n7-12th Midterm Information\\xa0\\n5 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n6th grade Midterm information\\xa0\\n5 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSmart History-  Chartres Cathedral\\n6 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nGothic Art History from  Goodbye-Art Academy\\n6 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMedieval Art History Overview  Goodbye-Art Academy\\n6 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nCeltic Art History  from Goodbye-Art Academy\\n6 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMaking  Manuscripts\\n6 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSmart History- The Pantheon, Rome\\n7 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSmart History- Parthenon Frieze\\n7 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAncient Greek Vase Production \\n6 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nGoodbye-Art Greek Art History\\n7 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nGoodbye-Art Roman Art History\\n7 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s the point of studying paintings in Pompeii\\n8 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRochelle Kornas\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\nNext ►\\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMs. Rochelle  Kornas\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\nFine Arts Department Chair\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPhone\\n281-391-5003\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArt Home\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nMs. Kornas Bio\\n6th Grade Art History\\nStudio Art I\\nStudio Art II\\nStudio Art III\\nArt Wish List\\nPosts\\nVideos\\nPhoto Album\\n©Aristoi Classical Academy\\n5618 Eleventh St.\\nKaty,\\xa0 TX\\xa0 77493\\nPhone:\\xa0 281-391-5003\\nFax: 281-391-5010\\nPowered by Edlio',\n",

I pray thee, wish not one man more.By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;It yearns me not if men my garments wear;Such outward things dwell not in my desires.But if it be a sin to covet honour,I am the most offending soul alive.No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.God\\'s peace! I would not lose so great an honourAs one man more methinks would share from meFor the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!Rather proclaim it, Westmorland, through my host,That he which hath no stomach to this fight,Let him depart; his passport shall be made,And crowns for convoy put into his purse;We would not die in that man\\'s companyThat fears his fellowship to die with us.This day is call\\'d the feast of Crispian.He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam\\'d,And rouse him at the name of Crispian.He that shall live this day, and see old age,Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,And say \"To-morrow is Saint Crispian.\"Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,And say \"These wounds I had on Crispin\\'s day.\"Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,But he\\'ll remember, with advantages,What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,Familiar in his mouth as household words—Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester—Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb\\'red.This story shall the good man teach his son;And Crispin Crispian shall ne\\'er go by,From this day to the ending of the world,But we in it shall be rememberèd—We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;For he to-day that sheds his blood with meShall be my brother; be he ne\\'er so vile,This day shall gentle his condition;And gentlemen in England now a-bedShall think themselves accurs\\'d they were not here,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin\\'s day.\\n3 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nBrittany Revia\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nKING ARTHUR VIDEO\\n3 months ago\\n by\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nBrittany Revia\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nNext ►\\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Brittany  Revia\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\nTeacher - 6th Grade\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHome\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEnglish\\nHistory\\nMeet the Teacher\\nVideos\\nPosts\\n*March 29: Heroes & Villains Interview Project due; Spelling Quiz\\n*March 30: NO SCHOOL/GOOD FRIDAY\\n*April 5: Saints & Scholars Celebration of Knowledge (History)\\n*April 12: Map Quiz\\n*April 13: Spelling Quiz\\n*April 18: Shoulders of Giants Essay Due\\n*April 24: Death and Disease Celebration of Knowledge (History)\\n*April 27: Spelling Quiz\\n*May 3: Map Quiz\\n*May 8: A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream Celebration of Knowledge\\n*May 10: 100 Years\\' War, Fall of Constantinople, and Wars of Roses Celebration of Knowledge\\n*May 11: Field Day\\n*May 14/15: STAAR TESTING\\n*May 17: Monologue Project Due\\n*May 24: Pastport Day\\xa0\\n*May 25: FINALS\\n*May 28: NO SCHOOL\\n*May 29-31: FINALS\\n*May 31: LAST DAY OF SCHOOL\\nremind\\n2017-18 Parent-Student Handbook \\n2017-18 Spelling Bee Word List\\n6th Grade -English Syllabus 2017-2018\\nMedieval History Syllabus 2016.docx\\n©Aristoi Classical Academy\\n5618 Eleventh St.\\nKaty,\\xa0 TX\\xa0 77493\\nPhone:\\xa0 281-391-5003\\nFax: 281-391-5010\\nPowered by Edlio',\n",

I often say that I have the greatest job at ACA because I get to teach kids how to \"play\" and be\\xa0\\nphysically\\n\\xa0active and I get to know each student in the school. I look forward to a great year!\\nAbout K-4th Physical Education\\xa0Class\\n:\\nPhysical Education will be an\\xa0environment\\xa0for students to learn about physical activity, sportsmanship, and health/nutrition. PE class activities will work to reinforce the cognitive skills and the academic learning initiated in the classroom setting.\\xa0\\nKindergarten - 1st\\ngrade:\\xa0\\nKindergarten and first students will focus on mastering gross motor skills, various physical activities, as well as reinforcing social development.\\xa0Basic skills will be taught through coordinated activities, games and fitness stations. We will be using a curriculum called \"Ready Bodies, Learning Minds,\" that focuses on a child\\'s\\xa0development\\xa0and what it means to learn.\\xa0\\n2nd - 4th grade:\\nSecond, third and fourth grade students will focus on developing sports skills, physical activity and social development. Students will learn the rules and regulations of sports such as volleyball, football, soccer, and general fitness. We will work on developing sportsmanlike conduct and teamwork. Third and fourth grade students will participate in the Texas state assessment, \"Fitness Gram.\" We will conduct bench mark test at the beginning of the year and take the actual test near the end of the spring semester. Fitness Gram is used solely as a tool for ACA to report the health and fitness level of our students to the state of Texas.\\nCommunication with Mrs.\\xa0Steen\\nAny concerns for individual students are typically communicated through \"notes home\" in the child’s folder or through email. You are\\xa0strongly encouraged to communicate with Mrs. Steen\\xa0by email if you or your student have questions or concerns, or set up a time to discuss in person during her conference period. Mrs. Steen\\xa0looks forward to working with your student and teaming with you to build a positive relationship between all of us - so that the end result is that the students in PE\\xa0class learn about Physical Education\\xa0and appreciate it.\\xa0\\nTentative PE\\xa0Events for the 2017-2018 School Year\\nFitness Gram Pre-Test\\n\\xa0- October\\xa0\\n2017\\nFitness Gram Test - March 2018\\nLower School Tentative Field Day - May 4, 2018\\n.\\nCONFERENCE PERIOD:\\n \\xa0 Monday - Friday \\xa011:20\\xa0- 12:10\\xa0pm\\xa0\\nCONTACT ME: hsteen@aristoiclassical.org\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0| \\xa0 \\xa0281.391.5003\\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Heather  Steen\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\nTeacher - PE (Grades K-4)\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHome\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nBio\\nSchedule\\n©Aristoi Classical Academy\\n5618 Eleventh St.\\nKaty,\\xa0 TX\\xa0 77493\\nPhone:\\xa0 281-391-5003\\nFax: 281-391-5010\\nPowered by Edlio',\n",

Over the years, I have had the privilege of using the classical method in the classroom, and I am passionate about teaching children how to become critical and analytical thinkers across all content areas. \\xa0I love to travel to foreign locations and experience new cultures, visit with friends in New York City, and spend time with my family!\\nAs we begin a new year together, I am looking forward to working in partnership with you in order to help your child achieve as much as possible. I will only be in your child’s life for a brief time- a fleeting school year- and I would like to make a contribution that lasts a lifetime. You are and will continue to be your child’s most important teacher. For several years now, you have had the opportunity to watch your child grow and develop into the youngster he or she is today. You know what makes your child “tick”. In order for me to best serve your child and family, your input is very valuable. Please take a few quiet minutes over the next several days to sit back and reflect on your child. I would love for you to write (handwritten or email) to me about the dear children you are putting in my care this year. What are the things you, as a parent, would like me to know? I would love to know how your child thinks, feels, plays, and how you see your child as a learner. What are your goals for your child this year? \\nThird grade is an exciting time as children embark upon new adventures in the world of learning.\\xa0 \\nI am looking forward to a very exciting and productive year working with your child.\\xa0 I will strive each day to make learning a fun and enriching process.\\n Please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have during the year!\\nBlessings, \\nMiss Nesbit\\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Laryssa  Nesbit\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\nTeacher - 3rd Grade\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMy Bio/Welcome\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nDaily Schedule\\nPhoto Album\\nReading/ELA Reviews\\nMath and Science Reviews\\nWeekly Spelling Words \\nMs. Nesbit\\'s Wish List \\nI taught in Charlotte, NC for 13 years. \\nI taught children in Bundibugyo, Uganda. \\nI always dreamed of teaching and living in NYC.

Those discussions impressed upon me the reality that classical education could transform education, especially public education.\\nI believe that Aristoi Classical Academy could become a model for other campuses in the future.\\xa0 Like the original ACA, these other campuses would follow our mission to provide students with “an academically challenging Classical Liberal Arts education that encourages them to develop a passion for learning and that gives them the means to become responsible citizens of virtuous character.”\\nI believe all children can learn. Classical education is the foundation that will allow children to become the adults they were meant to be.\\xa0 Our teachers and staff are committed to helping students become wise and intelligent citizens who will promote the True, Good, and Beautiful.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs our vision states, Aristoi Classical Academy\\xa0\\n“aims to graduate young men and women who seek the truth in all things;\\xa0\\nwho understand that learning is a life-long pursuit; \\nand who listen carefully (grammar), reason critically (logic), \\ncommunicate clearly, and write persuasively (rhetoric).\\xa0 \\nWe desire them to be honorable citizens who seek to improve their\\xa0\\ncommunities and the world rather than passively traveling along\\nthe road most followed.\\xa0 We desire to cultivate in our students the\\nvirtues of courage, moderation, and wisdom.\\xa0 We aim for them\\xa0\\nto be humble and magnanimous when dealing with others. \\xa0\\nWe seek to help each student become who he or she is meant to be.” \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbdavidson@aristoiclassical.org\\n\\t\\t281.391.5003\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVAILABILTY\\n\\t\\t...by appointment only\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tYou may also click the email icon on the right and contact\\n\\t\\tCathy Sturm,  Administrative Assistant to the Headmaster.\\n\\t\\tMrs. Sturm\\'s direct phone:  281.574.6112\\n\\t\\t*** Appointments for Mrs. Davidson are made via email only.***\\t\\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMrs. Brenda  Davidson\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\nSuperintendent & Headmaster\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPhone\\n281.391.5003\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHome\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nBio\\n©Aristoi Classical Academy\\n5618 Eleventh St.\\nKaty,\\xa0 TX\\xa0 77493\\nPhone:\\xa0 281-391-5003\\nFax: 281-391-5010\\nPowered by Edlio',\n",

I am so excited to have a fresh 2018 start\\xa0 with each one of your kids. I think we can all agree that we needed a reboot to regain enough\\xa0stamina in order to go about happily throughout the year. Today, I felt very refreshed and happy to be with each one of my students.\\nHere are some business pointers to help you have a heads up on what is happening in class.\\n*January 11th....Greek temple project is due. The handout with the details was sent home some weeks ago but you can also find a copy in my website.\\n*January 5th ....Last day to recite the poem \\xa0\"A Poison Tree\"\\n*We will no longer be using Spelling handouts, instead each student will have his/her own vocabulary workbook to use for the entire semester.\\n*This semester we will be studying\\xa0Roman history.\\n*We have finished reading\\n\\xa0The Trojan War\\xa0and now we will be reading the following books: The Golden Fleece, and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\\nPlease remind your child to write all assignments down in their planner. Some students are still struggling with organization. If your child is one of them please check their binder daily to help him build good organization habits. I can only do so much in school; the rest is really up to you!\\nAlso, today we discussed goals for 2018. I highly encouraged them to work on improving their friendships and becoming more mature and responsible by helping with chores at home. I hope this year we can work more closely to help these children\\xa0cultivate in their lives \"the virtues of justice, courage, temperance, and wisdom.\" (Core belief 3) My goal this semester is not only to finish the year with 5th graders but to help each one of them grow in character so that they can be well prepared for 6th grade.\\nOn another note, please forgive me for not sending out Remind text anymore. My app has a glitch and I am working on fixing it as soon as possible. In the meantime, please check your emails and the website for the latest news.

Before coming to Aristoi I taught PK & Kindergarten in HISD for three years. I even took a year off between working at Aristoi and HISD to do an internship in Bedford, England, where I was a volunteer support worker for an organization that served the poor and homeless.\\nWhen not working, I enjoy traveling, reading, cooking, painting, and spending time with family & friends.\\nOne accomplishment I am proud of is winning a Fund for Teachers grant in 2012. I received $5,000 and used it to attend the Oxford English Language Teachers’ Summer Seminar at Exeter College in Oxford, England. Not only did I learn from master teachers in such a prestigious & idyllic environment, I also had the pleasure of meeting teachers from around the world and building friendships with these amazing educators.\\nI love to spend my summers travelling! I’ve spent two summers in the Dominican Republic and had the pleasure of teaching English classes to Haitian immigrant children living in Pontezuela, a poor community in eastern Santiago. This past summer I spent time in Amsterdam and Athens, working with Syrian refugees. One of my favorite things is to come back to Aristoi after the summer and share these experiences with my students. \\nName\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMs. Deborah  Guel\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPosition\\nStudent Services Coordinator\\nEmail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSend email\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nPhone\\n281.391.5003\\nLess info\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhat\\'s this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBio\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEducational Resources\\nSummer 2014\\nPhoto Album\\n©Aristoi Classical Academy\\n5618 Eleventh St.\\nKaty,\\xa0 TX\\xa0 77493\\nPhone:\\xa0 281-391-5003\\nFax: 281-391-5010\\nPowered by Edlio',\n",
