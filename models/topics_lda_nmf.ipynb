Rs the Mobile County Public School System has expanded its focus to three new ones—rigor relevance and relationships\\nEvery high school now offers Advanced Placement courses\\nFocused attention is being brought to ensure that more students are reading on grade level at the end of third grade—a leading early indicator of starting on track to graduation\\nLikewise more students are taking the math courses they need to handle algebra in middle school an indicator that students remain on track\\nTo ensure every student in Mobile County graduates ready we are raising the bar\\nFor the first time starting in the 2014-15 school year every high school student will take the ACT college entrance exam—not just those who can afford it or those with stated plans to go to college\\nAnd we are working to increase the average ACT score to 21 a nationally recognized indicator that a student is prepared for—and can persist through—college-level courses\\nBeyond K-12 new attention across Mobile County is being paid to ensuring universal access to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten for our youngest learners ensuring that they start school ready to learn\\nThe school district is also working to ensure postsecondary access to students moving forward—whether in structured training opportunities two-year degrees in community college or associate programs or four-year university degrees\\nAs a result high school graduation rates in Mobile County are on the rise\\nThey are up nearly 20 percentage points in the past three years\\nThe reason is a combination of focus and accountability\\nFor students who are over-age and under-credited we have established new credit recovery options\\nWe have brought a laser-like focus to the issue making sure that schools offer more rigor to everybody not just some\\nEmployer Impact\\nThe best economic stimulus package in the Mobile region is increasing qualified high school graduates\\nAccording to the Alliance for Excellent Education If 90 percent of the MCPSS class of 2012 had earned a high school diploma an increase of 1900 graduates the benefits to Mobile County would include\\n100 new jobs\\n16 million increase in annual earnings\\n12 million increase in annual spending\\n19 million increase in annual gross regional product\\n28 million increase in home sales\\n2 million increase in auto sales\\n11 million increase in annual statelocal tax revenue\\nEvery high school in Mobile County is becoming a Career Academy—focused on the five key industry areas in the Mobile region aerospace advanced manufacturing shipbuilding health and teaching and learning\\nThrough partnerships with industry leaders—including internships job shadowing and mentors—students are being prepared in rigorous academics such as science technology math and engineering\\nThey are also learning the 21st century skills communications collaboration creativity and problem-solving they will need to succeed in these industries\\nCommunity Impact\\nIn 2001 Mobile County voters passed a historic tax referendum that put more money into our public schools than had been allocated in more than 40 years\\nIn 2011 citizens refused to step back—they voted to sustain that increased funding\\nAll the while people came together from every sector of the community—folks from churches businesses nonprofit organizations parents educators everyday citizens and taxpayers\\nAround kitchen tables in coffee shops churches and libraries they talked about what they want for Mobile County and our schools\\nIf they didn’t come out we went to them\\nThis broad-based citizen engagement is unique to the Mobile story\\nThe collective citizen voice enabled us to raise expectations\\nAnd it has brought us all together on a path for continued success\\nCitizens agree that our quality of life depends on the region being business friendly family friendly and safe\\nCitizens also know that improving our schools and the quality of our graduates can do a lot to improve other factors that contribute to the overall quality of life in Mobile County\\nBy improving the quality and employability of our graduates we increase their chances of higher annual earnings\\nThat gives Mobile County the opportunity to broaden our tax base which can lead to better parks bike trails recreation options and improvements in the arts—all giving families more to enjoy near home\\nThose factors can in turn help to keep our middle class thriving in the region\\nAnd a better quality of life in Mobile can help to keep our young people from looking elsewhere when thinking of where to build their lives and families\\nAll of that can help to increase our volunteer base and the number of people actively caring for and continuing to support our community\\nImproving Education Outcomes\\nGet Involved\\nTogether MAEF working with the Mobile County Public Schools and leaders throughout the community will create a civic culture of continual improvement by\\nEstablishing the entry-level skills needed for Mobile’s workforce and partner with schools to increase the number of students who graduate prepared for high wage high demand CS\\nEnsuring 80 by 20 results by designing managing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of district and community work systems\\nCollaboratively building human capital competencies aligned with performance-based assessments\\nSecuring funding and align resources to support innovation in career and college programming\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick

initiative of education civic and business leaders aimed at ensuring that all students in Mobile County are\\nPrepared for success in college and the workplace\\nAble to apply learning in the real world\\nEquipped with 21st century workforce skills\\nThe purpose of the Graduate Ready is to provide multiple personalized pathways and whole child supports for every child that ensure a better quality of life for every citizen of Mobile County\\nThe four key strategies of the Graduate Ready initiative include\\nEnsure high-quality teaching and learning from Pre-K through 12th grade\\nTransform all secondary schools to ensure that all students graduate from high school ready for college and career\\nEnsure postsecondary access and completion\\nSustain improvements through continued education business and civic leadership\\nA key component of Graduate Ready is the creation of signature Career Academies at each of Mobile County’s 12 high schools\\nThese academies align closely with the business community and with colleges and universities to prepare students for careers that are growing and thriving in Mobile\\nBusiness partner involvement is crucial to this endeavor to provide opportunities such as internships teacher externships shadowing classroom presentations and mentoring to students enrolled in these academies\\nBy 2015 all Mobile County public high schools will have a signature academy and a corresponding business advisory group that will provide hands-on working environments geared toward supporting college and career readiness\\nGraduate Ready is more than just an initiative of MAEF\\nIt is strategic focus for every program and activity of the organization\\nIt is a North Star that focuses our direction in every engagement with every partner\\nFor more information on Graduate Ready please contact\\nChandra Scott\\n\\nGraduate Ready Four Strategic Points\\nGraduate Ready sets four strategic priorities for the Mobile community\\nPriority 1 Support high-quality teaching and learning\\nEducation research is very clear that the single greatest factor for improving student achievement is the quality of the teacher\\nStudents can never graduate ready for college and careers without having consistent high-performing teachers throughout their school years\\nMobile County has many excellent teachers\\nBut we need an effective teacher in every classroom\\nTo help all teachers we also need high-quality instructional leadership in every school\\nAnd our students need high-quality academic and enrichment out-of-school supports to extend their learning and growth before school after school and in the critical summer months\\nPriority 2 Create middle and high schools that prepare students for the 21st Century\\nMobile County has made significant progress with its elementary school performance providing students a solid foundation for middle and high school\\nHowever in middle and high school student engagement and motivation drops off sharply\\nWhile our graduation rate is increasing it’s still not high enough\\nFurthermore many students who receive a high school diploma in Mobile do not have the skills they need to be successful in college and careers\\nTo ensure that every student in Mobile County is ready for the challenges they face after high school we must put the same energy and resources into transforming our secondary schools that we put into our elementary schools\\nPriority 3 Invest in student success after high school\\nA strong K-12 system is the foundation for college and career-ready young Mobilians\\nBut simply graduating with a high school diploma is not enough\\nMany students still need support and guidance to get into college and to persist in addressing the challenges they face in achieving their college and career goals\\nIn Mobile County we lack a coordinated network of supports for students after high school\\nSuch a network can help students access postsecondary opportunities apply for and receive the financial aid they require and get the mentoring and advice they need to persist in their goals and ultimately to attain gainful employment and promotable opportunities\\nCollege and Career Resources\\nPriority 4 Support Graduate Ready by investing in MAEF\\nMAEF is the premier community-based non-profit organization focused on improving preK-20 public education in Mobile County\\nFor nearly 30 years MAEF has helped to change local policy transform local schools and engage countless citizens in efforts that have increased student achievement and narrowed the achievement gap for deserving students\\nMAEF has a proven track record of stewardship and performance and serves as the fiscal agent for all county-side activities related to ensuring that Graduate Ready goals are met\\nContribute Now\\nSearch\\nQuick Links\\nPriority 1 Support\\nPriority 2 Prepare\\nPriority 3 Success\\nPriority 4

We Can one of MAEF’s best-known and most significant initiatives is a structured and deliberative community engagement process designed to gather citizen input on issues related to the community and the schools that serve it\\nThe process was created by Carolyn Akers and used first in Mobile after the historic tax referendum passed in 2001\\nThe goal of the first round of Yes We Can community conversations was convened to launch the creation of a genuinely community-driven student-centered strategic plan for the Mobile County Public School System\\nUp until Yes We Can the school district had created strategic plans but without the insight and from a broad representation of cross-sector community participation\\nThis strategic planning process was different it was “co-owned” by the community and the school system\\nBolstered by what was then the new federal “No Child Left Behind” law and motivated in large part by the Yes We Can Community Agreement that resulted from this community engagement the Mobile County School Board joined forces with MAEF and the growing community school reform coalition\\nTogether they developed an unprecedented performance-based strategic plan for the school system underscoring a shared commitment to making student achievement and organizational accountability their top priorities\\nIn 2003 at the end of that historic strategic planning process another round of community engagement was convened across Mobile County to update and revisit the community-driven strategic plan\\nThis new plan called the PASSport to Excellence was based on the Baldrige Quality standards then considered the most rigorous and effective model for reshaping educational organizations to create high-performance results\\nThen again in 2006 another round of Yes We Can engagement focused on 35 community meetings starting September 28 2006 that took place for seven consecutive Thursday nights across Mobile County\\nEach meeting attended by stakeholders across a number of sectors in the community—including educators parents business and community leaders students and higher education officials—served two purposes\\nThe first objective of these community meetings was to take what Akers called a “victory lap” acknowledging the changes made in the community and school system as a result of the 2001 tax increase\\nThe second purpose was to tap citizen concerns and aspirations for what the school system needed to do next to meet their expectations for high-quality schools in Mobile County\\nIn addition to providing meaningful citizen engagement into education in Mobile County the Yes We Can brand has become synonymous with citizen engagement that led to higher accountability for results that led to actual improvements in school and student performance\\nBecause the process led to tangible and demonstrable results cities across Alabama including Birmingham and Dothan as well as cities in states across the country such as Baton Rouge LA Jacksonville FL and Oshkosh WI have used Yes We Can as model for engaging their own citizens in the process of improving their local public schools\\nSearch\\nGraduate Ready\\nClick

Engineering EYE is a workforce and economic development initiative created to bring relevance to the K-12 mathematics and science curriculum\\nThe goal of EYE is to inspire engage and prepare middle school students to take the coursework needed to support the growing demand for highly skilled and technology-savvy workers for major industries located in the Mobile area including aerospace and shipbuilding\\nStudents use the Engineering Design Process to apply mathematics and science to solve relevant problems in the classroom and produce the technology and products needed in the world today\\nEYE includes the following programs\\nEYE Camps and Clubs\\nEYE camps and clubs offer engineering curriculum to fourth and fifth-graders at 25 Mobile County schools\\nStudents attend EYE clubs during the school year and then have the opportunity to continue the EYE program at teacher-led summer camps\\nEYE camps and clubs use the Boston Museum of Science “Engineering is Elementary” units and are led by trained teacher leaders\\nMiddle Grades Modules\\nFunded through a grant from the National Science Foundation EYE Middle Grades Modules are weeklong engineering units that incorporate science and mathematics\\nEach module is specifically designed to bring relevance and rigor to existing curriculum with a special emphasis on mathematics\\nEach module also provides an engineering design challenge fosters the development of “engineering habits of mind” integrates technology and other resources to meet the learning needs of a diverse group of students and deepens understanding of middle grades mathematics and science content\\nTeacher Workshops\\nOne goal of EYE is to use the engaging work of engineers as innovative problem solvers to “hook” students at the upper elementary and middle grade levels so they will choose to take the higher level science and math courses and develop critical thinking and communication skills required for students to be either work or college-ready in the 21st century\\nEngineering Pathways Integrated Curriculum EPIC is a specialized math and science path that arms students to enter post-secondary education qualified for engineering majors or other geotechnical geological physical meteorological or environmental fields as well as those interested in pursuing education majors in those areas\\nEPIC includes a strong math and science component\\nInterested students must commit to the required curriculum of additional math and science coursework as well as enrichment activities\\nMCPSS STEM Improvement Program\\nIn 2010-11 the Mobile County Public School System MCPSS developed the STEM Improvement Program in response to growing demand for all students to experience challenges that bring relevance to and integrate mathematics and science content similar to those found in the EYE modules\\nBased on recommendations from the district’s STEM Improvement Advisory Team MCPSS decided to implement its STEM Improvement Program and STEM Standards initially at the middle grades before expanding to the elementary and high school levels\\nIn partnership with members of the STEM Alliance MAEF developed the\\nSTEM Community Blueprint\\nwhich represents the culmination of years of dedicated efforts to support the district’s education outcomes and the community’s workforce development efforts\\nThe Blueprint is designed to\\nArticulate a vision for STEM education in Mobile County Alabama\\nDescribe the previous achievements in developing a foundational STEM education movement in Mobile County\\nReport the current status of STEM education and it’s connection to existing education and workforce development strategies\\nIdentify critical next steps and priorities for all

Multiple Pathways Blueprint initiative providing 295 million in funding to design and implement systems that connect young people who have dropped out of high school to alternative learning opportunities\\nMobile efforts were focused on engaging youth in career preparation and encouraging them to pursue postsecondary education\\nIn response to a cohort dropout rate of 503 percent Mobile County formed a collaborative of community business K-12 and higher education leaders called Research Alliance for Multiple Pathways RAMP for Mobile’s Youth\\nRAMP included the\\nDevelopment of a system and infrastructure necessary to monitor progress report findings engage the public and drive and sustain the work required and\\nCreation of a blueprint that addresses the needs of Mobile’s students that have either already dropped out of the education system or are at risk of doing so\\nThese outcomes were dependent on connecting key partnerships and resources in an alliance for maximum impact\\nKey partners in our alliance included the Mobile mayor the Mobile County Public School System the University of South Alabama Bishop State Community College Mobile Works which coordinates the Workforce Investment Act activities the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce the office of the District Attorney and MAEF which coordinated all of the work associated with development of the RAMP Blueprint\\nSeven years after the RAMP initiative began in Mobile the work is still going strong through two projects referred to as RAMP UP including and extended learning and summer transition program\\nExtended Learning Experience\\nThe RAMP UP Extended Learning Experience ELE helps students improve their academic performance by partnering with parents to create a roadmap to graduation\\nThe program aims to elevate students to another ELE Excellence Leadership and Empowerment\\nIt does this by\\nsupporting rigor in the classroom\\nincreasing the relevance of academic content for students and\\nestablishing supportive relationships between students and caring adults\\nELE is designed to support student achievement using individualized intensive instruction supported by Compass Learning including electronic diagnostic assessments for the delivery of a personalized learning experience\\nSummer Transition Program\\nThe RAMP UP Summer Transition Program set students up for success with opportunities to participate in self-examination aspirations and goal-setting exercises and to develop their high school and career plan\\nOver six weeks students in the program receive prescriptive and engaging lessons that target critical skill gaps in grades six through eighth in math that will afford them opportunities to advance to algebra when entering the ninth grade\\nEarly collegecareer culture enhancement sessions are planned for students and their parents for discussion on qualifications admissions financial aid and literacy work student scholarships internships fellowships and hiringinterview process\\nAt the close of the summer students will present formal portfolios indicating their level of readiness and preparedness for their high school experience\\nStudents who successfully complete the RAMP UP Summer Transition Program transition to high school with a half credit\\nFor more information on RAMP or RAMP UP please contact\\nHilder
